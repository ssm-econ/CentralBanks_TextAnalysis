1. The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy interest rate at 4.25 percent. This decision is consistent with an inflation forecast in which inflation converges to the target range during 2017 and takes into account the following factors:  
 
i) Expectations of inflation in 12 months’ time remain within the target range and continue showing a declining path; ii) The prices of some food products are being affected by climate alterations, their impact being expected to be temporary;  iii) The pace of growth of domestic economic activity has slowed down in the last quarter of 2016 in a context of lower public expenditure. Economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters as a result of increased investment and better terms of trade, and  iv) The global economy shows signals of recovery, although there is greater uncertainty regarding developed countries’ policies.  
 
2. The Board oversees new data on inflation and inflation determinants in the forecast horizon to evaluate the convenience of making additional adjustments in the monetary policy rate.    
 
3. Inflation in January showed a rate of 0.24 percent due to rises in the prices of some food products, which has led the year-to-year rate of inflation to decline from 3.23 percent in December to 3.10 percent in January. Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.04 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate increased from 2.87 percent in December to 2.98 percent in January, level within the target range.
