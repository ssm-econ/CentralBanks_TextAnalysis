i) Expectations of inflation in 12 months have increased slightly, but continue showing a declining path within the target range in the next two years; ii) The water deficit generated by adverse climate factors has been affecting inflation in transitory manner;  iii) Domestic economic activity is expected to grow at a rate close to its potential growth level in the following quarters, and  iv) The global economy shows signals of recovery and lower volatility in international financial markets.

Inflation without food and energy recorded a rate of 0.15 percent, as a result of which the year-to-year rate remains at 3.00 percent.
