 The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference rate at 4.25 percent. 
 
This decision is based on the fact that the rate of inflation is within the target range in a context of economic growth close to the economy’s potential level of growth .  
 
The Board oversees the inflation forecasts and inflation determinants to consider future adjustments in monetary policy instruments. 
 
2. In May, inflation registered a rate of 0.19 percent mainly as a result of the rise observed in the price of some food products. Inflation in the last 12 months rose from 2.31 percent in April to 2.46 percent in May. Core inflation in May showed a rate of 0.25 percent (3.32 percent in the last 12 months) while inflation excluding food and energy showed a rate of 0.15 percent (2.33 percent in the last 12 months).    
 
Inflation is expected to converge to the middle of the target range in the next months due to the improvement observed in the conditions of food supply, to a pace of growth of economic activity close to the economy’s level of potential output, and to inflation expectations anchored to the target range.  
 
3. Current and advanced indicators of activity show that the growth of the Peruvian economy is around its long-term sustainable level of growth, even though the indicators associated with the external market still show a weak performance that affects the prices and volumes of export products.  
 
4. The Board also approved to maintain the annual interest rates on lending and deposit operations in domestic currency (not included in auctions) between the BCRP and the financial system, as described below: 
 
a. Overnight deposits: 3.45 percent. b. Direct repo and rediscount operations: 5.05 percent. c. Swaps: a commission equivalent to a minimum annual effective cost of 5.05 percent. 
 
5. The Board will approve the Monetary Program for July on its session of July 11, 2013.
