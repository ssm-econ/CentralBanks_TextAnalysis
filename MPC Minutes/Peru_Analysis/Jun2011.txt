The Board of the Central Reserve Bank of Peru approved to maintain the monetary policy reference at 4.25 percent. 
 
This measure takes into account the moderation of increases in consumer prices and in some indicators of activity. Future adjustments in the reference rate will depend on new information on the evolution of inflation and its determinants.
