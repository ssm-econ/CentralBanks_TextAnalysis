Canada’s InflatIon-Control strategy*

Inflation control and the economy
•	Inflation control is not an end in itself; it is the means whereby monetary policy contributes to solid economic performance.
•	Low, stable, and predictable inflation allows the economy to function more effectively. This contributes to better economic growth over time and works to moderate cyclical fluctuations in output and employment.

The monetary policy instrument
•	Announcements regarding the Bank’s policy instrument—the target overnight interest rate—take place, under normal circumstances, on eight pre-specified dates during the year.
•	In setting a target for the overnight rate, the Bank of Canada influences short-term interest rates to achieve a rate of monetary expansion consistent with the inflation-control target. The trans- mission mechanism is complex and involves long and variable lags—the impact on inflation from changes in policy rates is usually spread over six to eight quarters.

The targets
•	In February 1991, the federal government and the Bank of Canada jointly agreed on a series of targets for reducing total CPI inflation to the midpoint of a range of 1 to 3 per cent by the end of 1995. The inflation target has been extended a number of times. In November 2006, the agree- ment was renewed for a period of five years to the end of 20 1. Under this agreement, the Bank will continue to conduct monetary policy aimed at keeping total CPI inflation at 2 per cent, with a control range of 1 to 3 per cent around the target.

Monitoring inflation
•	In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by transitory fluctuations in the prices of such volatile components as fruit and gasoline, as well as by changes in indirect taxes. For this reason, the Bank uses a core measure of CPI inflation as an indicator of the underlying trend in inflation. This core measure excludes eight of the most volatile components of the CPI and adjusts the remaining components to remove the effect of changes in indirect taxes.

Monetary Policy Report

July 2010

























THIS IS A REPORT OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE BANK OF CANADA:
MARK CARNEY, TIFF MACKLEM, PIERRE DUGUAY, JOHN MURRAY, TIMOTHY LANE, AND JEAN BOIVIN.

 








 














Now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Public and private boldness, both at home and abroad, will be required to secure the recovery.
This means G-20 action to reform the global ﬁnancial system and to secure a sustainable recovery. This means investments by our busi- nesses to improve productivity and to gain new markets. This means Canadians should fully engage the new multi-polar global economy.

These are all big decisions. How quickly and how effectively they are taken will inﬂuence activity and inﬂation in Canada and, there- fore, the stance of monetary policy. The Bank will need to be agile.

Overview


The global economic recovery is proceeding but is not yet self-sustaining. Greater emphasis on balance sheet repair by households, banks, and governments in a number of advanced economies is expected to temper the pace of global growth relative to the Bank’s outlook in April. While the policy response to the European sovereign debt crisis has reduced the risk of an adverse outcome and increased the prospect of sustainable long-term growth, it is expected to slow the global recovery over the projection horizon. In the United States, private demand is picking up but remains uneven.
Economic activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected, led by govern- ment and consumer spending. Housing activity is declining markedly from high levels, consistent with the Bank’s view that policy stimulus resulted in household expenditures being brought forward into late 2009 and early 2010. While employment growth has resumed, business investment appears to be held back by global uncertainties and has yet to recover from its sharp con- traction during the recession.
The Bank expects the economic recovery in Canada to be more gradual than it had projected in April, with growth of 3.5 per cent in 2010, 2.9 per cent in 2011, and 2.2 per cent in 2012. This revision reﬂects a slightly weaker proﬁle for global economic growth and more modest consumption growth in Canada. The Bank anticipates that business investment and net exports will make a relatively larger contribution to growth.
Inﬂation in Canada has been broadly in line with the Bank’s April projection. While the Bank now expects the economy to return to full capacity at the end of 2011, two quarters later than had been anticipated in April, the underlying dynamics for inﬂation are little changed. Both total CPI and core inﬂation are expected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period. The Bank will look through the transitory effects on inﬂation of changes to provincial indirect taxes.
The risks around this projection remain elevated and are judged to be roughly balanced over the projection horizon. Globally, on the upside, the boost in conﬁdence as advanced countries restore ﬁscal sustainability could generate greater-than-expected offsets to the ﬁscal consolidation. On the downside, global private demand around the world, including in the United States, may be insufﬁcient to sustain the recovery.
In Canada, there are important two-sided risks to the outlook for private demand. On the upside, private demand might have greater momentum than expected, reﬂecting strong conﬁdence and easy credit conditions. On the downside, it is possible that households reduce expenditures more than

currently anticipated or that the recovery in business investment is further delayed.
Since April 2010, with improvements in the economy, the Bank has ended its extraordinary conduct of monetary policy. On 20 April 2010, the Bank removed its conditional commitment, which had provided considerable additional stimulus during a period of very weak economic conditions and major downside risks to the global and Canadian economies.
On 1 June 2010, the Bank raised its target for the overnight rate by one- quarter of one percentage point to 1/2 per cent. As part of that interest rate decision, the Bank re-established its normal operating framework for the implementation of monetary policy, resetting the target for the overnight rate at the midpoint of the operating band and the width of the operating band to 50 basis points. On 20 July 2010, the Bank raised its target for the overnight rate by a further one-quarter of one percentage point to 3/4 per cent.
These decisions leave considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inﬂation target in light of the signiﬁcant excess supply in Canada, the strength of domestic spending, and the uneven global recovery. Given the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global economic developments.

The Global Economy




 

The global economic recovery is proceeding (Chart 1) but is not yet self- sustaining. Greater emphasis on balance sheet repair by households, banks, and governments in a number of advanced economies is expected to temper the pace of global growth relative to the Bank’s outlook in April. The intensiﬁ- cation of sovereign debt concerns in Europe has led to increased uncertainty, a tightening of global ﬁnancial conditions, and a reduction in world com- modity prices. The hand-off from public stimulus to private demand in advanced economies is proceeding but has yet to be accomplished.
In most advanced economies, monetary policy is likely to remain stimula- tive for some time, but ﬁscal stimulus is expected to be neutral to negative over the coming year. While the policy response to the European sovereign debt crisis has reduced the risk of an adverse outcome and increased the prospect of sustainable long-term growth, it is expected to slow the global recovery over the projection horizon (Technical Box 1).1 Private demand is expected to become the main driver of global growth through 2011–12 as the recovery in employment and household income gradually builds.

The Sovereign Debt Crisis in Europe: Impact on the Global and Canadian Economies


 
Given that the euro area represents more than 20 per cent of the global economy (at current prices), the sovereign debt crisis in Europe has global implica- tions. The debt crisis erupted at the beginning of May, amid heightened concerns in ﬁnancial markets regarding the sustainability of ﬁscal positions in several vulnerable euro-area countries, most notably Greece. Since much of this debt was held by banks across the euro area, concerns were also expressed about the resilience of certain banks. These concerns and the resulting ﬁnancial market tensions have increased uncertainty about the global economic recovery. Several measures have been taken by the European Union, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund to contain the crisis, and many European countries have accelerated their plans for ﬁscal consolidation.
The sovereign debt crisis in Europe is expected to affect the global and Canadian economies through both trade and ﬁnancial channels. Accelerated ﬁscal consolidation and tighter credit conditions in the euro area will reduce domestic demand in that region, thus decreasing European demand for imported goods and services. The recent deprecia- tion of the euro, if maintained, will further reduce European demand for imports. Since exports to the euro area account for only a small percentage of Canada’s total exports, this effect is expected to be relatively modest. However, developments in Europe are also transmitted to Canada indirectly, through a softening of U.S. demand for Canadian exports and reduced demand for commodities, putting down- ward pressure on Canada’s terms of trade and the Canadian dollar.
The debt crisis has also led to increased stress in the interbank market, higher risk spreads, and declines in asset prices. While the effect on ﬁnancial markets has been relatively contained thus far, ﬁnancial conditions could tighten signiﬁcantly, particularly in Europe, if concerns about counter- party risk were to persist, or even escalate. As well, uncertainty about the outlook could erode business and consumer conﬁdence and dampen spending.
To date, these effects have been modest, but they could intensify. “Safe haven” portfolio shifts could increase the demand for U.S.-dollar assets, which
 
would put downward pressure on the Canadian dollar. A lower value for the Canadian dollar would help to mitigate the adverse impact on aggregate demand in Canada from the European debt crisis.
Table 1-A provides an assessment of the impact of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis on the base-case scenario for the Monetary Policy Report.

It should be noted that the downside risk of a more pervasive crisis persists; if realized, the impact could be sizable. First, a severe disruption to bank funding markets could increase borrowing costs for ﬁrms and households. Second, the negative effects on Canadian exports could be substantial.
 



 
THE GLOBAL ECONOMY
BANK OF CANADA  MONETARY POLICY REPORT  JULY 2010
 
Recent Developments

 
Growth in many regions of the world was stronger than expected in the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, supported in particular by temporary government incentives that led households to pull their expenditures forward. As a result, second- quarter growth in many countries is projected to have slowed as these temporary effects dissipated. While there is strong momentum in many emerging-market economies and some consolidation of the recoveries in the United States, Japan, and other advanced economies, growth remains weak in Europe.
U.S. real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent in the ﬁrst quarter and is estimated to have grown by 2.4 per cent in the second quarter—in both instances slightly weaker than expected at the time of the April Report. Growth over this period has been supported by ﬁscal and monetary stimulus, as well as by the post-recession turn in the inventory cycle. Recent data on consumption and residential investment indicate, however, that growth will likely be more subdued than previously expected, consistent with weak growth in employment recorded in the second quarter (excluding the tem- porary jobs related to the census). Consequently, the recovery in U.S. private domestic demand is likely to be more gradual than previously expected.
Economic activity in the euro area recovered modestly in the ﬁrst quarter, supported by sustained growth in government spending and exports, as well as by a sizable contribution from inventories. Private ﬁnal domestic demand remains weak, however. More recently, incoming data related to industrial production have generally been stronger than projected, suggesting that growth in the second quarter has improved, reﬂecting in part the resumption of activity after weather-related disruptions in the ﬁrst quarter and increased export sales. The recovery is strongest in the core European countries, especially in Germany, with little evidence to this point of spillover effects from weakness in vulnerable economies.
In Japan, real GDP growth in the ﬁrst quarter, at 5.0 per cent, continued to rebound sharply, supported by substantial ﬁscal stimulus and a strong increase in exports. This momentum is expected to have slowed in the second quarter as government stimulus was scaled back. Although net exports continue to be an important contributor to growth, a number of indicators suggest that Japan’s economic recovery is slowly broadening.
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, China’s economy grew at a stronger-than- expected rate of 11.9 per cent (on a year-over-year basis), driven by robust internal and external demand. Growth eased to 10.3 per cent in the second quarter, however, as the effects of ﬁscal stimulus began to fade and the measures introduced by Chinese authorities to cool activity in the property market started to take hold. There is evidence that the economy may be in a state of excess demand, with wages rising and price pressures in some sectors mounting. The authorities have responded by tightening credit conditions through a variety of measures, and growth in credit and asset prices has started to decelerate.
The Bank of Canada’s index of global commodity prices has declined by about 4 per cent since the release of the April Monetary Policy Report, driven by decreases in the prices of oil and non-energy commodities, which were partially offset by an increase in natural gas prices (Chart 2 and Technical Box 2). Much of the decline in commodity prices can be attributed to a general shift away from riskier assets over this period and an expected slowing in the global economic recovery due to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the tightening of policy in China.

Developments in Global Financial Markets
Despite evidence that the global economic recovery is progressing, there have been renewed strains in ﬁnancial markets arising from growing concerns about sovereign risks in some European countries and related bank expos- ures. These ﬁnancial tensions highlight the vulnerabilities that still exist in the global ﬁnancial system.
At the time of the April Report, the impact of concerns about sovereign risk had been largely conﬁned to an increase in government bond yields for some highly indebted European countries, especially Greece. At the end of April, one of the major risks identiﬁed in the last Monetary Policy Report was mater- ializing. Concerns about contagion and spillover effects became more acute, leading to a broader deterioration in conditions across ﬁnancial markets. The announcements of stabilization measures by European authorities and the International Monetary Fund have helped to improve market conditions since then, but spreads on sovereign debt for the most-affected countries in the euro area remain considerably wider than at the time of the April Report, and overall ﬁnancial conditions are tighter and more volatile.
The European debt crisis has increased uncertainty and led to concerns about possible spillover effects from the ﬁnancial system to the real economy. Elevated uncertainty in global ﬁnancial markets has caused an increase in volatility, a decline in equity prices, and a widening of credit spreads across a broad range of private sector assets, such as corporate bonds—albeit to levels well below those seen in the autumn of 2008 and the ﬁrst half of 2009 (Chart 3). The impact of the wider spreads on corporations’ borrowing costs has thus far been largely offset by lower yields on government bonds in the major economies (Chart 4), owing to a reassessment of growth prospects, expectations that policy rates are likely to remain extremely low (Chart 5), and portfolio shifts towards more-liquid and less-risky assets. While access to capital markets has improved following the disruption in early May, when concerns about sovereign risks peaked, corporate issuance in Europe and the United States remains below levels seen earlier this year.

The Bank of Canada’s New Commodity Price Index: The Fisher BCPI


 
Commodity prices have important implications for the performance of the Canadian economy and for the conduct of monetary policy. Accurately measuring price developments across a wide range of commod- ities is therefore important for the interpretation of the effects of price changes on the value of the Canadian dollar, the terms of trade, and the overall state of the Canadian economy. Since it was created in 1975, the Bank of Canada’s commodity price index has been a ﬁxed-weight index that was updated roughly every 10 years. There were updates in 1988, 1994, and 2003.
In order to produce a more accurate, representative, and ﬂexible index, the Bank of Canada recently intro- duced the Fisher BCPI as its new commodity price index.1 A key advantage of the new BCPI is the ability to update the weights on an annual basis, so that biases from changes in production values due to price movements are minimized (Chart 2-A).2

Another advantage of using the Fisher methodology is that commodities can be added and removed from the index over time.3 In addition, the Fisher BCPI is consistent with the Canadian system of national accounts, which makes the construction of a volume measure for Canadian commodity production rela- tively straightforward.
The most important commodity group for Fisher BCPI movements over the 1973–2009 period is energy (Chart 2-B). Energy prices are subject to signiﬁcant price ﬂuctuations that dominate the overall dynamics of the index. This is especially true in the years after 2000, when changes in energy prices accounted for much of the growth in the overall price index. For example, about 85 per cent of the increase in the Fisher BCPI in 2008 was driven by the 20.8 per cent increase in the energy component. The next most important contributors to the growth in the Fisher BCPI are metals and minerals, and forestry.

The Bank of Canada’s New Commodity Price Index: The Fisher BCPI


 
Although the composition of the index has changed over time, the new Fisher BCPI follows the old index relatively closely (Chart 2-C). There are three prin- cipal reasons for this result. First, the effect of volatile commodity price movements on the index dominates that of compositional changes over history, since the latter tend to be very gradual. Second, price move- ments are highly correlated across commodities because demand cycles tend to be synchronized.
Indeed, the higher the correlation between com- modity prices, the more similar indexes with different weights will be. Finally, by coincidence, there are offsetting movements in commodity-production weights and energy prices over the sample such that the average of the Fisher weights is almost identical to the old ﬁxed weights. Over time, the difference between the two indexes could increase. Also, it should be noted that, although the differences between the overall index levels are small, there are

Bank lending conditions have remained roughly unchanged in most advanced economies. The latest senior loan ofﬁcer surveys for the United States and Europe indicate that, for the most part, commercial banks have not tightened their lending standards further. U.S. regional banks are not as strong ﬁnan- cially as the large money-centre banks, and are therefore more constrained in supplying credit to businesses and households.2 In Europe, planned ﬁscal consolidation may result in slower short-term growth, which could make debt servicing more difﬁcult for households and ﬁrms, and result in further losses and a weakening of bank balance sheets. In addition, many European banks

hold large amounts of sovereign debt from vulnerable euro-area countries on their balance sheets. European authorities recently announced that they are performing stress tests to assess the vulnerability of their banks and will publish the results on 23 July 2010.

Outlook for the Global Economy
The Bank’s base-case projection assumes that the policy actions taken to date in Europe will be effective in preventing further deterioration in ﬁnancial conditions and the spread of contagion to other euro-area countries and beyond. Overall, the global economic recovery is expected to remain on track, but is likely to be more gradual than had been expected in the April Report, with growth projected to average slightly less than 4 per cent through 2012 (Table 1). Downward revisions to the outlook through 2011–12 reﬂect a more gradual recovery in private domestic demand, as well as the adverse effects of the sovereign debt crisis, including accelerated ﬁscal consolidation (Technical Box 1).

U.S. GDP growth is projected to be slightly weaker than in April, averaging 3 1/4 per cent through 2011–12.
 
Owing to the slow pace of the recovery and the existence of sizable output gaps, underlying inﬂation pressures in the major advanced economies continue to be limited (Chart 6). However, inﬂation pressures are rising in many emerging-market countries and are expected to pick up further over the projection horizon, in response to their strong economic performance and, in some cases, easy monetary conditions.
The U.S. economic recovery is projected to proceed more slowly than in previous cycles, reﬂecting somewhat weaker growth in the rest of the world, the unwinding of ﬁscal stimulus measures, and ongoing deleveraging by households and ﬁnancial institutions. With growth averaging 3 1/4 per cent through 2011–12, some excess capacity is expected to persist at the end of the projection horizon, given the depth of the recession and the pace of potential growth. U.S. GDP growth is projected to be slightly weaker than anticipated in the April Report, owing to the fallout from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and a more protracted recovery in private domestic demand. Although ﬁscal stimulus remains an important driver of growth in 2010, its withdrawal will have a dampening effect on U.S. economic growth over the rest of the projection period (Chart 7). The growth of consumption
is projected to be modest as households strive to rebuild their savings

(Technical Box 3),3 while the recovery in residential investment is expected to be restrained by foreclosure sales, limited access to credit for builders, and the payback from temporary tax incentives for homebuyers (which pulled housing demand forward). Growth in business investment is anticipated to pick up gradually, but is likely to remain sluggish relative to previous recov- eries (particularly investment in structures), owing to high levels of unused industrial capacity and tight credit conditions (especially for small businesses)

3	U.S. household wealth is still well below its level prior to the recession and has likely fallen further since the April Report, reﬂecting recent ﬁnancial shocks and the effects of lower equity prices.

Technical Box 3
Consumption and Savings in the United States and Canada
The Bank expects the recovery in U.S. consumer demand
 
to be protracted compared with past cycles, largely reﬂecting the need for households to repair their balance sheets. The U.S. personal savings rate has recently increased from an average of 1.8 per cent over the 2005–07 period to about 3.5 per cent. It is expected to reach about 5 per cent in 2011 as labour income increases, outpacing the projected rise in consumer spending (Chart 3-A). This deleveraging process should gradually bring the share of consumer spending in GDP closer to its long-run average over the projection horizon (Chart 3-B).
The share of consumer spending in Canada’s GDP has recently risen above its long-term average, supported by a sharp improvement in the terms of trade and stimulative monetary and ﬁscal policies. However, the deviation from
the long-run average is less pronounced and is expected to last longer in Canada, reﬂecting a more favourable situation for Canadian households (Chart 3-C). The net worth of Canadians in 2009 remained about 6 times their average disposable income, while in the United States, it has fallen
to slightly below 5.

(Chart 8). Although exports are projected to grow strongly over the pro- jection horizon, their proﬁle is lower than in the April Report because of weaker foreign demand and a stronger U.S. dollar.
The outlook for the euro area is clouded by recent developments in vul- nerable European economies. Economic growth is expected to be more subdued than projected in the April Report, owing to increased uncertainty, more aggressive ﬁscal consolidation, a deterioration in credit conditions reﬂecting stress in bank funding markets, and reduced conﬁdence. A slug- gish recovery is projected over 2010–12, supported by exports, which should beneﬁt from a weaker euro. Domestic demand is expected to remain muted, owing to modest growth in employment and wages, and higher taxes.
In Japan, the recovery is projected to proceed largely as expected in the April Report, with net exports remaining the main driver of growth. The withdrawal of government subsidies should slow the growth of consumption, while the appreciation of the yen since the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis will dampen export growth. Japanese monetary and ﬁnancial conditions are expected to remain very supportive.
Rapid growth in China is projected to converge gradually towards trend growth of approximately 8 to 9 per cent through 2011–12, in line with the gradual removal of ﬁscal stimulus, the implementation of credit-tightening measures (targeted at the property market and local government borrowing), and an assumed appreciation of the Chinese currency. Domestic demand is expected to remain the primary source of growth, since exports are likely to be adversely affected by the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, which is China’s largest export market.4 Other emerging-market economies are projected to experience robust growth over the next three years, supported in many cases by both strong domestic demand and technology-related exports.
The expected path for commodity prices over the projection horizon has been revised downwards since the April Report, reﬂecting the softer outlook for global economic growth. This is evidenced by a lower but rising track for

The Canadian Economy



 
The economic recovery in Canada is proceeding largely as expected, supported by ﬁscal and monetary stimulus, higher terms of trade, improved labour markets and household conﬁdence, and the recovery in the global economy. As in the April Report, the Bank expects the pace of growth in economic activity to slow, owing to the pulling forward of consumer expenditures and residential investment induced by the policy stimulus, and the gradual removal of the ﬁscal stimulus.
This deceleration is now expected to be slightly more pronounced in 2010 and 2011, largely reﬂecting the weaker and more uncertain outlook for the global economy relative to the April Report. Consumption growth is pro- jected to be more modest, in line with lower income growth. Uncertainty is also expected to dampen the rebound in business investment over the short term. However, the lower assumed value for the Canadian dollar should help to boost net exports. Overall, the level of economic activity in Canada is projected to return to full capacity slightly later than previously expected.
The projection for Canadian inﬂation is largely unchanged relative to the April Report, reﬂecting small and offsetting revisions to the outlook. Both total CPI and core inﬂation are projected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period. The Bank will look through the transitory effects on inﬂation of changes to provincial indirect taxes.

Recent Developments
Economic Activity
As expected in the April Report, Canadian real GDP rose sharply in the ﬁrst quarter, by 6.1 per cent (at annual rates), reﬂecting further solid growth in domestic demand, along with a continued recovery in exports. Further improvement in Canada’s terms of trade led to an even sharper rise in real gross domestic income (Chart 10).
In the ﬁrst quarter of 2010, the level of real GDP moved back up, close to its pre-recession peak, owing to ongoing ﬁscal stimulus, the strength in con- sumer spending, and robust residential investment (Chart 11). Household spending was somewhat stronger than anticipated in the quarter, supported by solid gains in labour income, improved conﬁdence, and favourable credit conditions. Growth in residential investment also exceeded expectations, as households rushed to take advantage of the home renovation tax credit before it expired at the end of January. A faster-than-expected turnaround in the inventory cycle also provided a considerable boost to overall GDP growth. However, with ﬁrms remaining uncertain about the sustainability of

the recovery in global demand, the rebound in business ﬁxed investment was more subdued than expected. Indeed, the level of business ﬁxed investment is still depressed, following a faster and deeper decline than experienced in previous recessions.
Recent indicators point to a slowing in real GDP growth to about 3.0 per cent in the second quarter. Consumer spending has moderated, while residential investment has contracted markedly, as expected, following the expiry of the renovation tax credit, the tightening of mortgage criteria, and the rise in mortgage rates. In contrast, the recovery in business investment is expected to have started, aided by increased purchases of machinery and equipment associated in part with a rebound in the oil sector. As well, government

expenditures have been boosted temporarily by spending associated with the G-8 and G-20 summits hosted by Canada in June.
Estimated Pressures on Capacity
Excess capacity in the Canadian economy continued to diminish in the second quarter. The various indicators that the Bank considers provide somewhat diverging results with regard to the magnitude of the decrease. The Bank’s summer Business Outlook Survey (http://www.bankofcanada.ca/ en/bos/2010/summer/bos0710e.pdf) suggests that the amount of excess capacity has diminished noticeably since its peak in the third quarter of 2009, with the percentage of ﬁrms reporting that they would have difﬁculty meeting an unexpected increase in demand rising to its highest level since the third quarter of 2008 (Chart 12). In contrast, the Bank’s conventional measure indicates that the output gap was still signiﬁcant.
Labour market conditions have continued to improve. In particular, employ- ment has increased very rapidly in recent months and is now essentially back to its pre-recession level (Chart 13). Nevertheless, the unemployment rate is still relatively high, and average weekly hours worked remain lower than they were before the recession. In addition, results from the summer Business Outlook Survey indicate that the percentage of ﬁrms facing labour shortages has risen only modestly from the trough reached in the fourth quarter of 2009.
On balance, the various indicators of capacity pressures are consistent with the Bank’s view that potential output grew at about 1.2 per cent in 2009 and
1.5 per cent more recently.5 In this regard, the Bank judges that the economy was operating at about 1 1/2 per cent below its production capacity in the second quarter of 2010.

Core inﬂation has evolved as expected, while total CPI inflation has been somewhat lower than projected, owing to lower prices for gasoline.
 
Inﬂation and the 2 Per Cent Target
Core inﬂation has evolved as expected in the April Report, while total CPI inﬂation has been somewhat lower than projected, owing mainly to lower- than-anticipated prices for gasoline.
Core inﬂation has edged down to slightly below 2 per cent in recent months, with the partial unwinding of transitory factors that boosted inﬂation early in the year (particularly the surge in the price of travel accommodations associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver) (Chart 14). More fundamentally, the easing of downward pressure on inﬂation stemming from the reduction of excess supply in the economy has been largely offset by the easing of upward pressure coming from the growth in labour compensation (Chart 15), which has helped to keep core inﬂation close to 2 per cent.

Recent survey measures indicate that inﬂation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 per cent target. The July Consensus Economics forecast for total CPI inﬂation in 2010 was 1.9 per cent. The Bank’s summer Business Outlook Survey reports that 95 per cent of ﬁrms are expecting average inﬂa- tion over the next two years to be within the Bank’s 1 to 3 per cent control range. The survey also shows that expectations are evenly spread between ﬁrms expecting inﬂation to be in the bottom half of the range and those expecting inﬂation to be in the upper half. Market-based measures of longer- term inﬂation expectations continue to lie within their historical range.
Canadian Financial Conditions
Canadian ﬁnancial markets have been relatively resilient in the face of stressful conditions in international markets. In particular, bank funding markets in Canada have been largely unaffected by pressures in global short-term funding markets. However, global stresses have led to a decrease in the prices of risky assets and some widening of risk premiums. Overall, financial conditions in Canada have remained favourable, providing ongoing support to the economic recovery.
Funding costs for Canadian banks have risen slightly since the April Report, owing to expectations of rising policy rates and somewhat larger risk pre- miums. Effective borrowing costs for Canadian households have also edged up, but are still at exceptionally low levels (Chart 16). In that context, the expansion of total household credit has remained robust (Chart 17).
Effective borrowing costs for Canadian businesses have also risen slightly since April, although they too remain exceptionally low. At the same time, the Bank’s latest surveys, the Senior Loan Ofﬁcer Survey (http://www. bankofcanada.ca/en/slos/pdf/slos2010Q2.pdf) and the Business Outlook Survey, indicate that credit conditions for ﬁrms have eased in recent months (Chart 18). In particular, the Senior Loan Ofﬁcer Survey reported a modest net easing for small business and commercial borrowers for the ﬁrst
time since the onset of credit tightening in the third quarter of 2007. Despite favourable borrowing costs, growth in total business credit continues to be sluggish, partly reﬂecting the relatively high level of liquidity held by the non- ﬁnancial corporate sector and weak investment.
 

 
Inﬂation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 per cent target.









Overall, ﬁnancial conditions in Canada have remained favourable, providing ongoing support to the economic recovery.









The Bank’s latest surveys indicate that credit conditions for ﬁrms have eased in recent months.

Growth in the narrow monetary aggregates remains well above historical experience, reﬂecting both the desire of households and ﬁrms to maintain liquid assets in a period of heightened uncertainty, and the limited incentive that low interest rates provide for investment in longer-term deposits. Growth in the broader aggregate M2++, in contrast, has slowed markedly since the end of 2009 and is now somewhat below its previous trend, consistent with subdued inﬂation pressures ahead.

Exchange Rate
The Canadian dollar has depreciated since the April Report, averaging
96.4 cents U.S. over the period, compared with the 99 cents U.S. value assumed in the April Report (Chart 19). The lower value for the Canadian dollar reﬂects in part the general appreciation of the U.S. currency in response to the European sovereign debt crisis and the recent declines in commodity prices.

THE CANADIAN ECONOMY BANK OF CANADA  MONETARY POLICY REPORT  JULY 2010
 
Outlook for the Canadian Economy

 










The economy is projected to grow by
3.5 per cent in 2010, 2.9 per cent in 2011, and 2.2 per cent in 2012.
 
The Bank’s base-case projection incorporates the following key assumptions: a Canada/U.S. exchange rate averaging 96 cents U.S.; energy prices in line with recent futures prices; and prices for non-energy commodities increasing progressively as the global economy recovers. Global credit conditions are expected to gradually improve over the projection horizon, although from a somewhat less favourable position than was expected in the April Report, reﬂecting the heightened concerns about sovereign debt in some European countries.
Aggregate Demand and Supply
The pace of real GDP growth is expected to moderate through the remainder of this year and into 2011 (Chart 20). As in the April Report, this moderation mainly reﬂects the pulling forward of consumer spending and residential investment in response to accommodative monetary policy and temporary ﬁscal measures, and the gradual removal of the ﬁscal stimulus. However, the accelerated global ﬁscal consolidation and the weaker and more uncertain global outlook imply a slightly more pronounced deceleration in economic growth in Canada than previously expected. There is also a slight shift in the composition of demand, away from domestic demand and towards net exports, reﬂecting mainly weaker consumption and import growth (Table 2). On an average annual basis, real GDP is projected to grow by 3.5 per cent in 2010, before slowing to 2.9 per cent in 2011 and 2.2 per cent in 2012. The economy is now expected to return to full capacity at the end of 2011.

Consumption growth is expected to be more modest than in April, reﬂecting slower growth in income.
 
The Bank continues to expect consumer spending to slow to a pace more consistent with income growth. With the growth of income now expected to be slightly softer than was expected at the time of the April Report, primarily because of the weaker global outlook and a lower assumed proﬁle for commodity prices, consumption is correspondingly expected to be lower. Over the projection horizon, household spending should continue to be sup- ported by a strengthening labour market.

As in the April Report, investment in housing is projected to weaken further through the remainder of 2010 and well into 2011. This reﬂects the signiﬁcant amount of activity that was moved forward in late 2009 and early 2010 by exceptionally low mortgage rates and the recently expired home renovation tax credit, together with tighter mortgage affordability and higher house prices.
The heightened level of uncertainty over the pace and composition of the global recovery is expected to continue to hamper business investment. This is consistent with the easing in the balance of opinion reported in the latest Business Outlook Survey with respect to intentions regarding
investment in machinery and equipment over the next 12 months. Nevertheless, business investment is expected to increase to levels consistent with pre- vious recoveries (Chart 21), driven by the need to expand capacity and to increase productivity in a more competitive international environment. The strong ﬁnancial position of the Canadian non-ﬁnancial corporate sector and easy credit conditions are expected to underpin these investments.
At the same time, with the adjustment in the stock-to-sales ratio largely com- pleted, business inventories are expected to provide only modest support to overall real GDP growth over the projection horizon.
As in the April Report, the Bank estimates that the contribution of government spending to real GDP growth will gradually decline and turn negative in 2011.
Aided by the lower value assumed for the Canadian dollar, exports are pro- jected to increase slightly more over the 2010–11 period than projected in the April Report, despite somewhat weaker growth in external demand. Imports are expected to increase less rapidly than in the April scenario, owing to softer ﬁnal domestic demand, reduced inventory accumulation, and the lower exchange rate.

The Projection for Inﬂation
The projection for Canadian inﬂation is largely unchanged relative to the April Report, reﬂecting small and offsetting revisions to the outlook (Table 3 and Chart 22). Although excess supply was somewhat smaller in early 2010 than previously assumed, slower growth in subsequent quarters results in a mod- estly more persistent output gap than in the previous proﬁle. In addition, the impact of lower energy prices on total CPI inﬂation is partially offset by the lower value assumed for the Canadian dollar.

As in April, the Bank’s base-case projection for inﬂation incorporates esti- mates for the effect of the harmonized sales tax (HST) in Ontario and British Columbia.6 According to the Bank’s calculations, the direct impact will be a temporary rise of 0.6 percentage points in the year-over-year rate of increase in total CPI lasting from July 2010 to June 2011. As part of the shift to the HST, most taxes currently paid on business inputs will be refunded through tax credits. While this reduction in production costs should have some offsetting effect on consumer prices over time, the extent and the timing of this effect are difﬁcult to assess. The Bank’s base-case projection assumes that these cost savings will be transmitted gradually during the second half of the year, eventually reducing core and total CPI by a cumula- tive 0.3 percentage points, all else being equal. In addition, the Bank’s base- case scenario now incorporates the announced increase in the provincial sales tax in Quebec, effective in January 2011, which is expected to add about 0.1 percentage points to total CPI inﬂation over 2011. As has been the case with previous changes in indirect taxes, for the purposes of monetary policy, the Bank will look through the ﬁrst-round effect of these tax changes on prices.
With inﬂation expectations well anchored, core inﬂation is expected to remain near 2 per cent throughout the projection period. The recent deceleration in the growth of labour compensation, which is expected to persist and to be reinforced by the spending restraint measures recently announced in the public sector, is contributing to a marked slowdown in the growth of unit labour costs. Combined with a cyclical pickup in labour productivity, this slowdown is expected to gradually reduce inﬂation pressures. This effect is expected to be offset by the gradual absorption of excess supply. Over the next year or so, the transitory effect of the introduction of the HST is pro- jected to keep core inﬂation slightly below 2 per cent, as the tax refunds to businesses are passed through to consumers. At the same time, total CPI

THE CANADIAN ECONOMY BANK OF CANADA  MONETARY POLICY REPORT  JULY 2010
 
inﬂation (excluding the effect of changes in indirect taxes) is projected to be more subdued than in April and to remain somewhat below 2 per cent, mainly because of lower expected energy prices. Thereafter, both core and total CPI inﬂation are expected to be at the 2 per cent target.
This projection includes a gradual reduction in monetary stimulus consistent with achieving the inﬂation target.
The uncertainty surrounding the Bank’s inﬂation projection is illustrated using fan charts. Chart 23 and Chart 24 depict the 50 per cent and 90 per cent conﬁdence bands for year-over-year core inﬂation and total CPI inﬂation from the third quarter of 2010 to the end of 2012.7

Risks to the Outlook


Some of the risks identiﬁed in the April Report have materialized. Most notably, sovereign debt concerns in Europe have intensiﬁed. Policy actions taken in response have reduced the likelihood of an adverse outcome and have enhanced medium-term sustainability. Nonetheless, the risks around this projection remain elevated.
Uncertainty surrounding the global outlook is an important risk for inﬂation in Canada. On the upside, the boost in conﬁdence as advanced countries restore ﬁscal sustainability could generate greater-than-expected offsets to the ﬁscal consolidation. There is also a risk that momentum in emerging- market economies could be stronger than currently anticipated, particularly if measures to cool demand prove less effective than expected. On the downside, private demand around the world may be insufﬁcient to sustain the recovery. In the United States, elevated uncertainty and high unemploy- ment may induce households to increase savings and reduce consumption growth more than is currently expected. In Europe, slower growth in pri- vate demand could set in motion an adverse feedback loop between growth, ﬁnancial conditions, and ﬁscal balances.
In Canada, there are important two-sided risks to the outlook for private demand. On the upside, private demand might have greater momentum than expected, reﬂecting strong conﬁdence and easy credit conditions. On the downside, it is possible that households will reduce expenditures more than is currently anticipated to maintain their savings rate close to its recent average. Moreover, the projection assumes that investment will return to levels con- sistent with previous recoveries. Given the uncertainty around the global outlook, there is a risk that the recovery in investment could be further delayed.
The Bank judges that these risks are roughly balanced.
Over the medium term, global macroeconomic imbalances continue to pose signiﬁcant risks to the outlook. These imbalances narrowed during the reces- sion, as U.S. households curtailed their spending, while domestic demand in Asian emerging-market economies has been boosted by aggressive policy measures. The agreement by the G-20 leaders on policies to support strong, sustainable, and balanced growth, and the mutual assessment process, are important steps to reduce the risks associated with global imbalances.
However, it remains crucial that countries implement the agreed policies. Without this, large imbalances may re-emerge, with the attendant risk of disorderly adjustment.
