Canada’s Inflation-Control Strategy1


 
Inflation targeting and the economy
•	The Bank’s mandate is to conduct monetary policy to pro- mote the economic and ﬁnancial well-being of Canadians .
•	Canada’s experience with inflation targeting since 1991 has shown that the best way to foster conﬁdence in the value of money and to contribute to sustained economic growth, employment gains and improved living standards is by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable .
•	In 2011, the Government and the Bank of Canada renewed Canada’s inflation-control target for a further ﬁve-year period, ending 31 December 2016 . The target, as measured by the total consumer price index (CPI), remains at the
2 per cent midpoint of the control range of 1 to 3 per cent .
The monetary policy instrument
•	The Bank carries out monetary policy through changes in the target overnight rate of interest .2 These changes are transmitted to the economy through their influence on market interest rates, domestic asset prices and the exchange rate, which affect total demand for Canadian goods and services . The balance between this demand and the economy’s production capacity is, over time, the
primary determinant of inflation pressures in the economy .
•	Monetary policy actions take time—usually from six to eight quarters—to work their way through the economy and have their full effect on inflation . For this reason, monetary policy must be forward looking .
•	Consistent with its commitment to clear, transparent communications, the Bank regularly reports its perspec- tive on the forces at work on the economy and their
 
implications for inflation . The Monetary Policy Report is a key element of this approach . Policy decisions are typi- cally announced on eight pre-set days during the year, and full updates of the Bank’s outlook, including risks to the projection, are published four times per year in the Monetary Policy Report .
Inflation targeting is symmetric and ﬂexible
•	Canada’s inflation-targeting approach is symmetric, which means that the Bank is equally concerned about inflation rising above or falling below the 2 per cent target .
•	Canada’s inflation-targeting framework is flexible . Typically, the Bank seeks to return inflation to target over a horizon of six to eight quarters . However, the most appropriate horizon for returning inflation to target will vary depending on the nature and persistence of the shocks buffeting the economy .
Monitoring inflation
•	In the short run, a good deal of movement in the CPI is caused by fluctuations in the prices of certain volatile components (e .g ., fruit and gasoline) and by changes in indirect taxes . For this reason, the Bank also monitors a set of “core” inflation measures, most importantly the CPIX, which strips out eight of the most volatile CPI com- ponents and the effect of indirect taxes on the remaining components . These “core” measures allow the Bank to “look through” temporary price movements and focus on the underlying trend of inflation . In this sense, core infla- tion is monitored as an operational guide to help the Bank achieve the total CPI inflation target . It is not a replace- ment for it .

Renewal of the Inflation-Control Target: Background Information—November 2011, which are both available on the Bank’s website .
2	When interest rates are at the zero lower bound, additional monetary easing to achieve the inflation target can be provided through three unconven- tional instruments: (i) a conditional statement on the future path of the policy rate; (ii) quantitative easing; and (iii) credit easing . These instruments and the principles guiding their use are described in the Annex to the April 2009 Monetary Policy Report .

Global Economy

 
Global economic growth remains modest, although the pace of economic activity varies significantly across the major economies. The U.S. economic expansion is proceeding at a moderate pace, with the continued strength- ening in private demand being partly offset by the impact of fiscal consoli- dation. In Japan, fiscal and monetary stimulus is contributing to a rapid recovery in economic growth. In contrast, economic activity in the euro area remains weak, owing to fiscal austerity, fragmented access to credit and low confidence. While stronger than in the advanced economies, real GDP growth in China and other emerging-market economies has slowed, exerting downward pressure on global commodity prices.
Global financial conditions remain very supportive, despite an increase in bond yields and a more recent pullback from some risky assets. Consid- erable monetary policy stimulus remains in place in the United States and other advanced economies in response to continuing large excess supply gaps and persistent disinflationary pressures (Chart 1 and Chart 2).
The global economy is expected to grow at a rate of 2.8 per cent in 2013, before picking up to 3.5 per cent in 2014 and 3.7 per cent in 2015 (Table 1). The Bank’s projection is somewhat weaker than in the April Monetary Policy Report, owing primarily to a downward revision to real GDP growth in China and other emerging-market economies.

Global Financial Conditions
 
BANK OF CANADA
 
Global financial conditions continue to be very supportive. Although yields on most government bonds have risen sharply in recent months, they are still quite low by historical standards (Chart 3). As the global recovery, led by the United States, proceeds and downside risks recede, a normalization of interest rates will be both necessary and desirable. As this process unfolds, some short-term volatility and temporary overshooting are to be expected.
Yields on higher-rated U.S. corporate bonds have moved up in tandem with government bond yields, but remain close to historical lows. Some other
U.S. assets, including real estate investment trusts, high-yield corporate debt and municipal bonds, have registered larger declines in prices. Yield spreads on euro-area peripheral sovereign bonds have also widened in recent weeks.1
Equity prices are at historically high levels in many advanced economies (Chart 4). Shifts in investor confidence regarding the implementation by the Japanese authorities of a three-pronged reform program have contributed to recent volatility in the Nikkei. Nevertheless, the index is still around
60 per cent higher than in November 2012, when expectations of aggressive stimulus policies first took hold.2
Emerging-market economies have experienced increased capital outflows in response to weakening domestic growth prospects and higher interest rates in advanced economies. As a result, bond yields in emerging mar- kets have risen, equity prices have fallen and currencies have depreciated, despite interventions by many central banks.

The U.S. economic expansion is projected to become
more firmly entrenched




















Consumption is projected to grow at a more solid pace
 
Source: Bloomberg	Last observation: 12 July 2013


United States
The U.S. economic expansion is projected to become more firmly entrenched as the effects of fiscal consolidation and household delever- aging gradually dissipate. Highly accommodative monetary policy continues to play a key role in supporting the recovery.
Growth in U.S. real GDP picked up to 1.8 per cent in the first quarter, under- pinned by a moderate increase in consumer spending and continued robust momentum in residential construction. Economic growth is estimated to have remained modest in the second quarter, but is expected to strengthen gradually through to mid-2014 and stabilize around 3¼ per cent thereafter.
Fiscal consolidation continues to weigh heavily on U.S. GDP growth (Chart 5). As noted in the Bank’s April Report, fiscal drag is expected to be 1.8 per- centage points in 2013, 0.8 percentage points in 2014 and zero in 2015.3
In contrast, monetary policy is projected to remain highly accommodative. The U.S. Federal Reserve has indicated that it may slow the pace of asset purchases later this year and end purchases around mid-year 2014, pro- vided that the outlook for economic activity and the labour market improves, as it anticipates. However, since the unemployment rate is expected to remain elevated and inflation pressures subdued, most members of the Federal Open Market Committee do not expect the first increase in the policy interest rate to occur until 2015.
Growth in consumer spending is estimated to have been modest in the second quarter of 2013 as households adjusted to previously enacted tax increases. Thereafter, consumption is projected to grow at a more solid pace, supported by further gains in employment and wages, easier access to credit, improving confidence, and the significant boost to household net
 

 
3	A number of near-term fiscal issues still need to be resolved. For example, the debt ceiling (the limit imposed by the U.S. Congress on the amount of debt the country can carry at any given time) was reached on 19 May 2013. The U.S. Treasury has introduced extraordinary measures that will allow it to continue to honour its financial obligations until October or November, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. The Bank’s projection assumes that an agreement will be reached and disruptions to U.S. government activities will be minimal.

worth from higher equity and house prices (Chart 6). Housing activity has been expanding at a rapid pace for several quarters, albeit from extremely low levels, and should continue to do so, supported by the same favourable fundamentals noted above and a rebound in household formation. The posi- tive feedback loop between the recovery in housing activity and consump- tion growth is expected to persist over the projection horizon. Given this dynamic and the considerable degree of household deleveraging that has already taken place, there is a risk that consumption and housing activity could surprise on the upside. If this were to occur, it would have a positive impact on business confidence and investment.

Growth in U.S. business investment is projected to rebound










Excess supply in labour and product markets is putting downward pressure on U.S. inflation
 
Excess capacity, together with uncertainty about future demand, has weighed on investment spending in recent quarters. Growth in business investment is projected to rebound, however, as confidence recovers and overall demand conditions continue to improve. The existing low cost of capital and strong financial position of corporations will provide further support (Chart 7). Rapid growth in the U.S. energy sector continues to drive spending on infrastructure, and the resultant lower energy prices will stimu- late U.S. economic activity.
Exports are projected to make an increasing contribution to U.S. economic growth, buoyed by a firming in foreign demand. Non-oil imports are also expected to rise in line with stronger domestic demand, while overseas oil imports will continue to be displaced by growing domestic production.
Ongoing excess supply in labour and product markets is putting down- ward pressure on U.S. inflation. Year-over-year growth in the price index for core personal consumption expenditures has slowed to 1.1 per cent in recent months, a record low. Over the projection horizon, U.S. inflation is expected to rise toward the 2 per cent inflation target as excess supply gradually diminishes.

Euro Area
In the euro area, real GDP fell by 1.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, owing largely to weak investment. Growth turned slightly positive in Germany but was negative in most other countries, owing to fiscal austerity, tight credit conditions, extremely high unemployment and low confidence (Chart 8). In light of the persistent weakness in economic conditions and subdued inflation, the European Central Bank reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points in May and later provided guidance that it would keep the rate low for an extended period. Financial fragmentation continues to impair the transmission of monetary policy, however, as reflected in the divergence between lending rates in the peripheral and core economies (Chart 9).

The level of economic activity in the euro area is expected to stabilize this year, with a gradual recovery unfolding in 2014. In 2015, growth is antici- pated to pick up somewhat, reflecting reduced drag from fiscal consolida- tion and some improvement in credit conditions.
The Bank’s projection assumes that the crisis in the euro area will continue to be contained. However, a sustained recovery will require further progress on bank deleveraging, structural and fiscal reforms, deeper economic inte- gration, and timely completion of the banking union.4 A possible reintensifi- cation of the euro-area crisis therefore remains a significant downside risk to the Bank’s projection.

4	Establishing the banking union has proven to be a challenging process and is far from complete. Further steps were taken in June and July as European Union finance ministers agreed on a broad framework and the European Commission developed a proposal for a single, EU-wide bank resolution mechanism. In addi- tion, it was agreed that the European Stability Mechanism will be allowed to directly recapitalize euro-area banks, albeit only after a bail-in of depositors and contributions from the associated national governments. While these measures still need to be legislated, if agreed to they would help to reduce the negative feed- back loop between troubled banks and sovereigns.

Japan
Japanese authorities are implementing an ambitious policy and reform program to boost the country’s growth prospects and end deflation.
This program is often referred to as the “Three Arrows” and consists of:
(i)	the adoption of a 2 per cent inflation target by the Bank of Japan and unprecedented quantitative monetary easing to achieve this goal within approximately two years; (ii) substantial fiscal stimulus in the near term, followed by fiscal consolidation starting in mid-2014; and (iii) structural reforms to promote long-term growth. Monetary and fiscal stimulus is having positive effects. Equity prices are significantly higher than in November, real longer-term interest rates on Japanese government bonds have fallen below zero, the yen has depreciated by more than 20 per cent against the
U.S. dollar and confidence has increased sharply. These developments have contributed to a rapid recovery in economic activity, with real GDP growth strengthening to 4.1 per cent in the first quarter of 2013.
 
Economic growth in Japan is projected to remain robust over the remainder of 2013
















Growth in China’s real GDP is projected to ease further, to 7¼ per cent
 
Economic growth in Japan is projected to remain robust over the remainder of 2013, averaging around 3 per cent, and to moderate thereafter in the context of increases in the value-added tax. However, the recent volatility in financial conditions highlights the challenges faced by the Japanese author- ities in implementing their “Three Arrows” agenda. Authorities have made it clear that, in addition to monetary policy, ambitious structural and fiscal reforms are essential for addressing issues related to Japan’s aging popula- tion and elevated public debt levels.

Emerging-Market Economies
Real GDP growth in China slowed to 7.5 per cent in the second quarter of 2013 on a year-over-year basis. The ongoing deceleration in China’s
economy has largely reflected weaker foreign demand and a moderation in the growth of investment spending. In addition, the authorities have recently introduced new measures to restrain both credit growth and activities in the shadow banking sector.5 These measures have contributed to the recent stress in China’s interbank market.
Growth in China’s real GDP is projected to ease further, to 7¼ per cent, through to the end of 2014, as weaker growth in public infrastructure invest- ment, excess capacity in some heavy industries and measures designed to reduce credit growth lead to a further slowing in the pace of investment. A gradual strengthening in consumption, sustained by solid labour market conditions and “consumption-friendly” structural reforms (Chart 10), should allow the growth of economic activity to stabilize at around 7½ per cent through 2015.6 Net exports contribute only slightly to GDP growth over the projection period, restrained by the continued appreciation of the real effective exchange rate for the renminbi. Compared with the April Report, real GDP growth has been revised down through 2015, reflecting tighter financial conditions. Efforts to rein in credit growth, existing imbalances
in the Chinese economy and challenges associated with shifting to con- sumption-led growth represent significant downside risks to the projection.
 

 
5	The growth of credit, as measured by total social financing, is slowing but remains elevated. In addition to “traditional” bank credit, total social financing includes a range of other forms of credit, such as trust products, corporate bonds and equity financing.
6	The government plans to raise household disposable income through increases in the minimum wage and improved social safety nets, such as health care and social welfare payments.

Real GDP growth in other emerging-market economies (EMEs), such as Russia and India, has also slowed in recent quarters, owing to structural constraints and weak external demand. Moreover, with economic growth moderating, EMEs are particularly vulnerable to global financial turbulence. Indeed, credit conditions have tightened following outflows of capital caused by reduced prospects for domestic growth and higher interest rates in advanced economies. Apart from a few central banks, monetary author- ities in a number of EMEs have lowered their policy interest rates and allowed some exchange rate depreciation, in response to the slower pace of eco- nomic growth. Macroeconomic stimulus measures, strengthening external demand and structural reforms (particularly those aimed at reducing supply bottlenecks) are expected to support a pickup in growth over the projection horizon.

Commodity Prices
Slowing demand in China and other EMEs, combined with some retreat from risky assets, has exerted downward pressure on many commodity prices in recent months, especially base metals prices.
Global oil prices, as measured by the Brent benchmark, are up somewhat relative to the April Report, in response to heightened geopolitical concerns. Oil prices in North America have increased significantly, however, benefiting from improved transportation capacity and a rise in seasonal demand that have helped to reduce inventories in the U.S. Midwest. As a result, the spread between the prices for Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has narrowed to approximately US$3, the lowest level in more than two years. The gap between WTI and Western Canada Select (WCS) has returned to a more normal level of roughly US$15, down from an average of US$35 in January. Natural gas prices continue to be driven by weather- related factors and have fallen by about 14 per cent.

The latest futures curves suggest that crude oil prices will decline
 
The latest futures curves suggest that crude oil prices will decline by roughly 11 per cent through 2015, consistent with a rise in global production, modest growth in demand and an expected decline in the risk premium associated with tensions in the Middle East (Chart 11). The spread between Brent and WTI prices is projected to widen slightly, and the gap between WTI and WCS prices is also anticipated to increase. Natural gas prices in North America are expected to rise to around US$4.30 per million BTU by the end of 2015, reflecting increased demand for electricity generation.
Prices for non-energy commodities have fallen by 7 per cent since the last Report. On balance, they are projected to remain unchanged
through to mid-2014, before rising gradually thereafter, owing to improved global demand. In response to a temporary slowdown in U.S. residential

construction, weaker Chinese demand and a strong increase in North American production, lumber prices have plunged by about 22 per cent, erasing the gains seen since last October. Prices are expected to rise over the projection horizon, however, driven by the continued strength in U.S. residential construction. In contrast, base metals prices are expected to weaken in the near term, in response to slowing demand (especially from China), rising production and high inventories (Chart 12). Prices for base metals are then expected to rise modestly starting in mid-2014, supported by a pickup in global demand.

Implications for the Canadian Economy
The Bank’s foreign activity measure, which captures the composition of foreign demand for Canadian non-commodity exports, has reversed only about 75 per cent of the decline registered during the 2008–09 recession, mostly reflecting the improving, but still low, level of activity in the U.S. residential construction sector. Over the projection horizon, however, the measure is expected to grow at a solid pace, averaging close to 5.5 per cent per year, supported by strong increases in U.S. business and residential investment in a context of continued improvement in household and busi- ness confidence. The foreign activity measure is projected to return to its pre-recession level in early 2014.
The Bank of Canada commodity price index (BCPI) has increased slightly since the April Report, owing to higher prices for crude oil (Chart 13). The BCPI is expected to remain relatively stable through 2015, with the effects of declining oil prices offset by a gradual rise in the prices of non-energy com- modities, including lumber and, eventually, base metals. As a result, the projected profile for commodity prices is not expected to provide significant additional support to Canada’s terms of trade over the projection horizon.
Oil prices nevertheless remain at historically elevated levels and should support Canadian business investment in the coming years.

Canadian Economy

 
The Bank expects the Canadian economy to grow at a moderate pace through 2015. While growth will be choppy in the near term as a result of unusual temporary factors, underlying momentum in the economy is expected to build into 2014. After picking up sharply in the first quarter of 2013, exports are projected to continue to recover, which should boost confidence and lead to increasingly solid growth in business fixed invest- ment (Chart 15). The economy will also be supported by continued growth in consumer spending, while further modest declines in residential invest- ment are expected. Growth in real GDP is projected to be sufficient to absorb the current material excess capacity in the economy around mid- 2015, contributing to a gradual rise in total CPI and core inflation to
2 per cent between now and then.
Relative to the April Report, the outlook for growth and inflation in Canada is little changed. While real GDP growth in the first quarter of 2013 was stronger than expected, the Bank foresees a somewhat more challenging external environment over the projection horizon than previously anticipated. This reflects slightly reduced expectations for global economic growth, which contributes to a lower profile for commodity prices.
Taking into account all of the risks bearing on the outlook, the Bank views the projection to be balanced.

Financial Conditions
 
Financial conditions remain accommodative





























Growth in total household credit has continued to slow
 
Financial conditions in Canada remain accommodative, underpinned by the considerable monetary policy stimulus currently in place (Chart 16).
Nevertheless, Canadian financial markets have experienced increased vola- tility since the April Report, reflecting developments in global markets.
As in other advanced economies, yields on Canadian government bonds have risen, reversing their decline from earlier in the year (Chart 3). Yields on corporate bonds have also increased, as has the volatility in credit spreads.
Still, Canadian bond yields remain low by historical standards, owing in part to strong international demand for Canadian fixed-income securities. Canadian equities have continued to underperform equities in most other advanced economies (Chart 4), largely reflecting the Canadian market’s relatively high exposure to developments in commodity prices.
Despite the recent volatility in capital markets, overall credit conditions for Canadian firms remain favourable, which is reflected in the responses to the Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey (available on the Bank’s website under Publications and Research > Periodicals > BOS Summer 2013) and Senior Loan Officer Survey (available on the Bank’s website under Publications and Research > Periodicals > SLOS 2013Q2). Both surveys suggest that, as of mid-June, credit conditions had remained broadly unchanged since last autumn, following a period of almost uninterrupted easing since late 2009 (Chart 17).
Against this backdrop, the growth of total business credit has moderated through the first five months of 2013 to a rate close to its historical average (Chart 18). This moderation follows very rapid growth in the latter part of 2012, which was boosted by the early refinancing of debt at low interest rates. Firms’ borrowing needs have remained relatively modest in recent quarters, given the weak growth of fixed investment and the relatively high cash positions of non-financial firms.
Borrowing costs for households remain very low (Chart 16), although some banks have recently announced increases in fixed-term mortgage rates in conjunction with the general rise in market interest rates. Growth in total

household credit has continued to slow since the April Report, to a rate considerably below its historical average (Chart 18 and Chart 19), and the ratio of household debt to disposable income has edged lower. The cumula- tive effects of changes to mortgage insurance rules and the tightening of mortgage underwriting guidelines, increasing consumer appreciation of the risks associated with elevated debt levels, and reminders about the eventual normalization of interest rates have all contributed to this downward trend. Recent data revisions confirm the sustained household response to these

Real GDP growth accelerated in the first quarter of 2013




The conventional measure of the output gap is now somewhat smaller than previously estimated
 
influences over the past several quarters, with the debt-to-income ratio revised lower. The Bank expects a flat-to-lower profile for the household debt-to-disposable-income ratio over the projection horizon.
Reflecting in part the passing of transitory factors, growth in the narrow monetary aggregates has slowed from its very rapid rate in the first quarter of the year. Growth in the broad monetary aggregates has moderated as well, mainly reflecting the contribution from narrow money. The overall trend in broad money remains consistent with the Bank’s inflation projection.

Estimated Pressures on Capacity
There continues to be a material degree of slack in the Canadian economy. As expected, real GDP growth accelerated in the first quarter of 2013, fol- lowing weakness throughout 2012. At 2.5 per cent (at annual rates), growth was stronger than estimated in the April Report, outpacing estimates of growth in the economy’s production potential for the first time in six quarters.
The first-quarter expansion was driven by a large pickup in exports, which reflected strengthening private demand in the United States in recent quar- ters and the reversal of temporary disruptions that restrained activity in the energy and mining sectors in the second half of 2012. At the same time, most major components of final domestic demand increased only modestly. The stronger growth in the Canadian economy in the first quarter, coupled with some modest upward revisions over the 2008−12 period, resulted in a real GDP level in the first quarter that was 0.5 per cent higher than antici- pated in the last Report. As a result, the conventional measure of the output gap is now somewhat smaller than previously estimated, at 1.0 per cent in the first quarter, compared with 1.2 per cent in April (Chart 20).
Growth in real GDP is forecast to have slowed sharply in the second quarter, to around 1.0 per cent. This slowing primarily reflects the immediate adverse impact on economic activity of the catastrophic floods in Alberta and the province-wide strike in the construction sector in Quebec in the latter part
of June (Box 1). Since the lost activity is expected to be largely recovered in the third quarter, the Bank will look through the volatility induced by these temporary factors when assessing the degree of excess capacity in the Canadian economy.
 




BANK OF CANADA

On balance, labour market indicators point to a greater degree of slack than the conventional measure of the output gap. The level of average hours worked continues to be significantly below its trend, while the proportion of involuntary part-time workers and the average duration of unemployment remain at elevated levels (Chart 21). Wage increases have remained sub- dued (Chart 22), consistent with the observed softness in price inflation in the services sector. Despite solid employment gains, the unemployment rate has continued to hover somewhat above 7 per cent. Finally, the Bank’s latest Business Outlook Survey finds little evidence of labour shortages.
By contrast, in the summer Business Outlook Survey, the proportion of firms expecting that they would have difficulty meeting an unexpected increase in demand has risen to around its historical average, suggesting limited slack in the economy. This is consistent with weak growth in the capital stock
in recent quarters, and with the survey findings that uncertainty continues to affect the investment decisions of many firms. As business confidence improves in response to evidence of firming demand, physical capacity can be expected to expand at a more significant pace. These investments will contribute to the reconstruction of the Canadian economy’s produc- tion potential by supporting stronger growth in productivity and helping to alleviate capacity constraints in some sectors.
Taking into account the range of indicators of capacity pressures, as well as the temporary nature of the factors affecting activity in the near term, the Bank judges that the economy was operating roughly 1¼ per cent below its production capacity in the second quarter of 2013, a similar degree of slack to that expected in the April Report.

Box 1

The Near-Term Economic Eﬀects of the Recent Flooding in Southern Alberta and the Quebec Construction Strike
 
The Canadian economy has been hit by a number of unusual events in recent weeks: catastrophic flooding in southern Alberta, the province-wide construction strike in Quebec, the tragedy in lac-Mégantic and severe flooding in Toronto . The ﬁrst two events are expected to have material implications for the near-term path of Canadian economic activity . The timing and magnitude of the impact on the economy of these events and their aftermath are subject to considerable uncertainty, and the rough estimates below rely on a number of assump- tions . Moreover, the impact of these events is expected
to result in greater volatility in economic indicators to be released over the coming quarters, which will complicate the analysis of underlying trends .
The devastating flooding in Alberta in late June affected all sectors of the province’s economy, so the impact on real GDP growth is estimated to be substantial . While the exact magnitude is highly uncertain, the Bank assumes that reduced activity in the region during the last 10 days of June lowered real GDP growth in the second quarter by
about 0 .7 percentage points . Following these severe disrup- tions, economic activity is expected to recover as the lost output is partially recouped and reconstruction begins . For these reasons, the Bank anticipates that growth in the third quarter will be boosted by about 1 .0 percentage points .
The construction strike in Quebec began on 17 June and affected all sectors of the industry . While workers in
 
residential construction and roadwork reached labour agreements after one week, the other sectors did not return to work until 2 July, after the provincial government passed special legislation to end the strike . Since the Quebec construction industry represents about 1 .4 per cent of the Canadian economy, the drag on growth is also estimated
to be signiﬁcant . Overall, it is estimated that the strike will shave approximately 0 .6 percentage points from real GDP growth in the second quarter before rebounding in the third quarter (adding about 0 .8 percentage points to growth) .
As a result of the direct effects of these events, the Bank estimates that growth (expressed quarterly at annual rates) was reduced by about 1 .3 percentage points in the second quarter (Table 1-A) . Given the temporary nature of the shocks and the eventual reconstruction and repair of damaged infrastructure in the flooded areas in Alberta, a boost of 1 .8 percentage points to GDP growth is expected in the third quarter .

The Real Economy
The Bank continues to forecast an improvement in the underlying momentum of the Canadian economy through mid-2014 as external demand increases and business confidence strengthens (Chart 23 and Table 2).
Nevertheless, the protracted nature of the recovery in U.S. and global demand remains an important headwind to the Canadian economy, particu- larly in the current environment of greater restraint in domestic household and government spending. Accordingly, as in the April Report, the profile for real GDP in Canada is projected to remain relatively subdued for this stage of the cycle (Chart 24).

The Canadian economy is expected to reach full capacity around mid-2015




Exports are projected to continue to increase at a solid pace
 
As noted earlier, economic growth in Canada is expected to be choppy in the near term. From an average rate of 2.4 per cent over the second and third quarters of 2013, growth is projected to rise gradually to 2.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2014 (Table 3). Given this projection for real GDP, the Canadian economy is expected to reach full capacity around mid-2015, as in the April Report.
After picking up sharply in the first quarter, exports are projected to continue to increase at a solid pace. The further recovery in U.S. business and resi- dential investment should particularly benefit those export sectors that have lagged thus far, notably machinery and equipment and lumber products (Chart 25).

economies should also help to improve Canada’s export performance.7 In spite of the expected solid growth ahead, the level of exports is not pro- jected to return to its pre-recession peak until the second half of 2014
(Chart 26). This reflects not only the protracted nature of the global recovery, but also ongoing competitiveness challenges and capacity constraints in some sectors that limit the ability of Canadian exporters to respond quickly to increased foreign demand (Box 2).




7 According to Export Development Canada’s spring Trade Confidence Index survey, one-third of exporters reported that they had already started selling to new markets in the past two years, and about half plan to expand into new countries over the next two years, with future diversification focusing on growth markets.

Box 2

The Capacity of Canadian Exporters to Respond to Rising Foreign Demand
 
Each quarter, the Bank’s regional oﬃces consult with businesses to gauge their views on economic activity over the next 12 months . When asked in the summer Business Outlook Survey about the channels through which they could respond to rising foreign demand for their products or services, about two-thirds of exporting ﬁrms reported some ability to respond through more intensive use of their Canadian capacity over the near term .1 These ﬁrms most often cited some flexibility to use or adjust their scale of operations—for example, by hiring temporary workers, increasing overtime, buying ﬁnished products or leasing facilities from their competitors—or by utilizing out-of-service capacity (Chart 2-A) . A relatively small share of exporting ﬁrms reported that they had recently added Canadian capacity to accommodate a sustained increase in foreign demand . In recent surveys, ﬁrms have reported delaying some larger-scale capital projects aimed at long-term capacity expansion, given the ongoing uncertainty about external demand . Many ﬁrms indicated that they also had the ability to respond to increased export demand through their facilities outside of Canada .
While most exporting ﬁrms indicate an ability to respond through their Canadian operations, a number of factors
 
whether to increase production at Canadian or U .S . facilities are influenced by the availability of timber, relative cost struc- tures, logistics and regulatory constraints . Similarly, in the auto sector, structural changes over the past decade have led to changes in the types of vehicle produced in Canada and the location of facilities within an integrated North American market . With some segments of the industry currently

operating at capacity, new investments would need to be made, yet Canadian locations are increasingly competing with foreign locations to attract those new investments .
Overall, consultations with industry suggest that, in the near term, most exporting ﬁrms have some capacity to respond to increasing foreign demand through their Canadian oper- ations, although the availability of foreign capacity and
 
competitiveness challenges may mitigate this response . Additional investment will be required in the medium to longer term to expand Canada’s export capacity and to ensure that Canadian ﬁrms can be successful in an increas- ingly competitive global marketplace . Uncertainty about the nature and timing of future demand growth is holding back these investments .

Following a strong recovery from the depressed levels experienced in the aftermath of the 2008−09 recession, the growth of business fixed invest- ment has weakened in recent quarters, reflecting concerns regarding the strength of both domestic and foreign demand, as well as challenges specific to the resource sector. As a result, growth in business fixed invest- ment is likely to remain moderate over the near term, despite the healthy aggregate financial position of Canadian firms, favourable credit conditions and the strong Canadian dollar, as well as the impetus to improve produc- tivity amid heightened pressures to become more competitive. Over the projection horizon, growth in business fixed investment is expected to strengthen as the recovery in Canadian exports becomes more firmly entrenched, providing greater confidence about the prospects for global demand.
In the first quarter of 2013, household spending failed to contribute mater- ially to real GDP growth for the first time since early 2009, since consump- tion rose only modestly and residential investment declined for the third consecutive quarter. This extends a recent trend toward slower growth in household spending, which, combined with the downward revisions to the debt-to-income ratio and upward revisions to the savings rate (Chart 27), points to increased household prudence.

Consumption is projected to increase at a moderate pace


Residential investment is projected to decline further from historically high levels
 
In the Bank’s forecast, consumption increases at a moderate pace, slightly above the rate of growth of disposable income. Nevertheless, the savings rate remains well above the average of the past decade—consistent with the persistence of a degree of household caution in the context of high debt levels. Residential investment is projected to decline further from historically high levels (Chart 28), reflecting lower rates of new construction as previous overbuilding is addressed (Chart 29), thus contributing to a more sustain- able path for the housing sector. Recent increases in fixed-term mortgage rates will also provide a degree of restraint. While the Bank expects house- hold caution to remain a constraint on spending over the forecast horizon, it is possible that, in an environment where borrowing conditions are still highly favourable, household expenditures could gather renewed momentum.

Government spending is expected to contribute only marginally to real GDP growth over the projection horizon (Chart 30). While this contribution is considerably weaker than has been typical historically, it is in line with the announced plans of federal, provincial and local governments to consolidate spending.

Inflation
Total CPI and core inflation have stayed low in recent months, and both are expected to remain subdued in the near term (Chart 31).
 
Inflation has stayed low in recent months and is expected to remain subdued in the near term






Total CPI inflation is expected to return gradually to
target around mid-2015
 
Low core inflation, averaging 1.1 per cent in April and May, continues to reflect persistent material excess capacity in the economy, heightened competitive pressures on retailers from both domestic and foreign sources, relatively subdued increases in wages amid slack labour market conditions, and a number of temporary sector-specific factors (Box 3). There remains some uncertainty regarding the importance of each of these factors in accounting for the low level of core inflation. Total CPI inflation, which aver- aged 0.6 per cent in April and May, has been restrained not only by low core inflation, but also by declining mortgage interest costs.
Core inflation is expected to remain subdued in coming quarters. As the economy gradually returns to full capacity and, with inflation expectations well anchored, core inflation is projected to rise to 2 per cent around mid- 2015.8 In addition, even though wage growth has been relatively modest recently, productivity growth has been weak. As a result, the growth of unit labour costs has risen somewhat above 2 per cent in recent quarters (Chart 32), and is expected to contribute to the gradual rise in core inflation.
Together with core inflation, total CPI inflation is expected to return gradually to target around mid-2015.
Indicators of inflation expectations are consistent with the Bank’s projection, which shows inflation remaining below the 2 per cent target until around
mid-2015. In this regard, the July Consensus Economics forecasts for total CPI inflation were 1.1 per cent in 2013 and 1.7 per cent in 2014. According to the latest Business Outlook Survey, inflation expectations have eased within the Bank’s inflation-control range, with a slightly greater majority of firms expecting total CPI inflation over the next two years to remain in the bottom half of that range. A number of firms cited the slow-growth environment as a factor driving their expectations. In the context of increased volatility in

Box 3

Special Factors Behind the Recent Weakness in Core Inflation
 
While the persistent slack in the Canadian economy and heightened competition in the retail sector have damp- ened core inflation, special factors have also played a role . This box reviews some of those key special factors,
particularly the pass-through from agricultural commodity prices and lower-than-usual rates of change in domestic regulated prices . As shown in Chart 3-A, in 2013, food prices have been the largest drag on core inflation relative to the average, followed by services (excluding shelter), which has been notably influenced by auto insurance

Food-price inflation has been driven largely by global movements in commodity prices
In Canada and in other major advanced economies, the run-up in core food-price inflation through 2011 and its subsequent decline have both been broadly in line with lagged movements in global agricultural commodity prices (Chart 3-B and Chart 3-C) . At the peak of the run-up in late 2011 and early 2012, the pass-through from higher agricultural prices helped to push CPIX inflation in Canada about 0 .2 percentage points above its historical average . On average in 2013, the muted food-price inflation arising from the commodity price cycle has pulled core inflation

2013, combined with the competitive environment, sug- gests that inflation in core food prices should converge only gradually to more typical rates .
Regulated prices have also played a role in the recent weakness in core inflation
Some regulated prices have also played a role in the recent weakness in the CPIX (Chart 3-D) . For example, power plant outages caused electricity rates in Alberta to increase sharply (71 per cent on a year-over-year basis) at the end of 2011, but they have since fallen signiﬁcantly, reaching a trough earlier this year . As well, regulatory changes kept auto insurance premiums2 in Ontario rela- tively flat in 2012 after material increases in previous years . Overall, developments in these regulated prices
account for 0 .1 percentage points of the weakness in CPIX inflation relative to its historical average . The current regulatory environment for auto insurance in Ontario and

2	Auto insurance premiums, which are part of core services (excluding shelter), account for 3 per cent of core inflation.
 

the proposed reduction in premiums included in the 2013 Ontario budget suggest that weak growth in premiums relative to the average could persist for some time . On the other hand, the impact of the outages at Alberta power plants has already disappeared from the year-over-year progression for electricity prices . Announced electricity rate increases in Alberta in the third quarter should result in a rebound in overall electricity prices in the CPI in the near term .
Without the above-mentioned special factors, which removed about 0 .3 percentage points of the CPIX relative to the average, the slowdown in core inflation would have been much less pronounced, with the CPIX hovering at around 1 .7 per cent on a year-over-year basis in the ﬁrst half of 2012 before moderating somewhat further in recent months (Chart 3-E) .3


3	To eliminate the effect of these special factors on core inflation, it is assumed that core food prices, semi-durables, electricity prices and auto insurance premiums grow at their 10-year historical average, while the remaining components of the CPIX progress at their observed rate.

Risks to thE outlook
BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POlICy REPORT  •  JUly 2013









Risks to the outlook	
The outlook presented in this Report balances the many upside and down- side risks to inflation in the projection. Four of the most important risks are described below: three of them emanate from the external environment, while one is domestic.

(i)	Stronger U.S. private demand
The major upside risk to inflation in Canada is stronger-than-expected private demand in the United States. The solid recovery in the U.S. housing market, and in the economy more generally, could generate stronger growth in labour income. Moreover, higher prices for housing and equities could cause household deleveraging to end sooner than expected. Together, these developments would result in more rapid growth in consumption and residential investment, which in turn would give businesses greater confidence in investing and hiring, thus creating a virtuous circle for U.S. private demand. Although this would likely be accompanied by higher interest rates, putting some upward pressure on rates in Canada, the boost to U.S. real GDP would more than offset the pressure on rates. Stronger demand in the United States would be transmitted to the Canadian economy through the trade channel and higher commodity prices.

(ii)	Euro-area crisis
Failure to contain the crisis in Europe remains the most serious down- side risk facing the global and Canadian economies. Although Canada has limited direct trade and financial exposure to Europe, if a euro-area country or large bank were to lose access to debt markets, leading to a sudden loss of confidence, financial contagion to the United States could cause U.S. credit spreads to widen and equity prices to fall. The knock- on effects in Canada from weaker U.S. demand and financial market turbulence would have significant consequences for our exports and for domestic economic activity.
Even if the situation in the euro area remains contained, weakness could persist longer than projected, owing to reform fatigue, persistently high unemployment, and delays in the necessary institutional reforms and balance-sheet repairs. The combination of weaker foreign activity, higher lending spreads, lower commodity prices and negative confidence effects would act as a drag on Canadian growth.

(iii)	Disorderly unwinding of household sector imbalances
The elevated level of household debt and imbalances in some segments of the housing market remain the most important domestic source
of risk to the Canadian economy. In the past several months, there
 
Risks to thE outlook
BANK OF CANADA  •  MONETARy POlICy REPORT  •  JUly 2013

has been a constructive evolution of household sector imbalances. Nevertheless, despite the continued slowing in credit growth, the level of debt remains high. In addition, some of the latest data point to the risk of renewed momentum in the housing market in the context of continuing very low borrowing rates. This renewed momentum would produce a temporary boost to economic activity and inflation, but more importantly, it would exacerbate existing imbalances and therefore increase the probability of a more severe correction later on. Such a correction could have sizable spillover effects to other parts of the economy.

(iv)	Weaker growth in China and other emerging-market economies Efforts by Chinese authorities to contain domestic financial risks may result in a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in credit growth and an
extended period of deleveraging. There is also a risk that the current
slowdown in economic activity in other EMEs could be more severe and protracted than the Bank has projected. In particular, the anticipated normalization of monetary policy in the United States could trigger larger capital outflows, tighter credit conditions and increased volatility in EME asset prices. Important structural reforms, which are necessary to expand potential growth, could also be delayed. The shock would
be transmitted to the Canadian economy through weaker export sales, lower commodity prices and a deterioration in our terms of trade.
