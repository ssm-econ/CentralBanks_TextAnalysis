committee decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at per cent per annum at this actions will be data dependent and determined by developments in the outlook and inflation inflation is currently at uncomfortable and a marked deterioration in the outlook may require action that we will hesitate to the mpc reiterates that a rising interest rate cycle does not that rates will be raised at each

offsetting effects from a further of the rand against the us inflation outlook has therefore changed but the impact of these developments on both inflation and growth in the longer will depend on the persistence of the oil price even a moderate in oil prices going forward will reverse the favourable inflation the inflation and growth while are expected to be the same the impact of load shedding

respectively compared with per and per cent in the preceding two decline in international oil prices has prompted a downward revision of the oil assumption in the forecasting with a significant impact on the inflation the longer term impact will be dependent on the of these lower which have been a reaction to global supply and factors as well as a change in the behavior of key oil with supply

deposit holdings of households increased by per cent compared to per cent for the corporate the growth in total loans and advances increased to per cent in compared to increases of around per cent in the previous three the growth in credit remained at around per cent in march and reflecting the strong demand for durable goods and mortgage inflation expectations remain with the latest survey from the bureau of economic research at the university of stellenbosch showing little change from the previous inflation expectations for all categories of respondents are still comfortably within the inflation target range for the next three although there was a slight increase in the forecasts of the market this was offset by a similar decline in inflation expectations of the trade also noteworthy is the fact that new business executive respondents had the same low expectations as those who have participated for some pressure on inflation from the supply side of the economy has growth in gross domestic product declined from an annualised rate of per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of as the slower growth was due primarily to the per cent contraction in the manufacturing this was partly a consequence of the strong rand which impacted negatively on the export and subsectors of this trend was also reflected in the continued downward trend in the leading business cycle indicator and the decline in manufacturing capacity utilisation from per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of this the slower rate of growth of per cent in the agricultural sector also contributed to the overall by the mining sector grew by an annualised rate of per the volume of gold production however declined to its lowest level since the when measured over four gdp growth was per high expenditure growth has also resulted in a higher value of merchandise although the increase of per cent in april was significantly less than the per cent increase recorded in exports which have been increasing steadily since rose by per cent in these developments have resulted in an improvement in the trade and may result in a moderate decline in the overall current account deficit which measured per cent of gdp in the fourth quarter of last by the end of may gross foreign exchange reserves had increased to and the international liquidity position had increased to the increase in reserves levels reflects a combination of foreign exchange operations conducted by the reserve bank for own account as well as on behalf of including foreign exchange purchases arising from a fdi supportive factors include the benign world which has been affected only marginally by the higher international oil and continued fiscal discipline in south administered price increases are still above the upper end of the inflation target but the downward trend although at a slow food price inflation has remained low while production price developments also indicate that there are few pressures emanating from rising input costs in the short risks to the inflation outlook appear to be fairly evenly according to the forecasting model of the cpix inflation is still expected to remain comfortably within the target range of per cent for the forecast the central forecast is for cpix inflation to peak in the first quarter of at a slightly higher level than previously and then to decline to a level of around per cent at the end of the fourth quarter of this moderately higher forecast is in part a consequence of revised expectations relating to petrol prices and the exchange and the easing in monetary policy all of the above into consideration the monetary policy committee has come to the conclusion that the current monetary policy stance remains appropriate to maintain inflation within the target this means that the repo rate remains unchanged at per cent per the mpc will continue as usual to monitor closely all the developments in the economy and the factors influencing and will stand ready to adjust the stance in either direction if depending on the outlook for headline inflation has now returned to within the target range as with in march and april surprising on the while the inflation outlook improved over the near the forecast trajectory is unchanged uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target the rand exchange and domestic bond yields benefited from increased global capital inflows to markets which largely offset the impact of the sovereign credit ratings with further ratings decisions risks remain for a further against the backdrop of continued global and domestic political economic growth prospects have as the impact of the ratings is expected to weigh on domestic investment and consumer sentiment the forecast the output gap is estimated to have and demand has the trajectory of the growth forecast is and the growth rate for this year is expected to exceed that recorded in

productivity and wage despite a weak us growth is expected to average above this although policy uncertainty could undermine investor and consumer rates in the euro area and japan are expected to be

sovereign credit ratings downgrades by two ratings having reached a weak point of almost against the us dollar in the rand subsequently recovered some of these losses in line with improved towards emerging markets in some of these gains were reversed effects of recent political uncertainty in since the previous the rand has appreciated by against the us dollar and depreciated by on a at current levels the rand is still more appreciated to rates prevailing at this time last the recent the rand has been supported by a more favourable account following a significant narrowing of the deficit in the final of last a further positive trade balance was recorded in the first quarter this but a moderately wider current account deficit is expected over the due in part to a recent deterioration in the terms of remained net buyers of domestic government bonds in april and may to the value of despite the recent ratings this change should further downgrades particularly with respect to domestic the rand therefore remains vulnerable to this as well as changes in global risk sentiment towards emerging domestic growth outlook has deteriorated amid weak business and consumer the forecast for gdp growth has been revised down for the forecast by percentage points for and and by points in annual growth rates of and for the years are now this downward revision is due in part to the impact of the

is forecast this real retail and wholesale trade sales contracted in the first quarter of while domestic sales of passenger motor vehicles the outlook the sector remains factors such as low consumer higher the absence of significant wealth effects and stagnant employment have contributed to these weaker consumption addition to these credit extension to the household sector in particular and is reflected in further household although credit to the corporate sector is still relatively the downward growth trend there be some relief to consumers from moderating while increases in real disposable income over the forecast period are also to provide some support to but to a lesser extent than salary and wage increases have continued to show signs of but still at levels that contribute to the persistence of inflation at higher while moderation of nominal unit labour costs are expected over most of the the trajectory has been revised slightly upwards largely due to the economic growth oil prices have firmed since the previous having declined to below per barrel at one the recovery was a response to that the opec agreement to curtail output would be extended for a six the

that there been downside surprises in core inflation as the current does not incorporate the most recent and further downside in the coming months could impact of the starting point of the forecast

repurchase rate at per five members preferred an unchanged stance while member preferred a basis point mpc remains of the view that the current level of the repo rate is appropriate for and that we are likely at the end of the tightening a reduction in rates be possible should inflation continue to surprise on the downside and the over the policy horizon be sustainably within the target in current environment of high levels of the risks to the outloo since the previous meeting of the monetary policy risks to the global outlook have increased against the backdrop of a slowing chinese these in conjunction with continued capital outflows from emerging have resulted in heightened global financial market volatility and to the decision by the us fed to maintain its current monetary policy this delay has added uncertainty to an already volatile global domestic economic outlook has deteriorated following the surprise contraction in second quarter of the at the same the rand experienced a further depreciation in response to domestic and global the upside risks to the inflation the combination of sharply growth and rising inflation compounds the dilemma facing monetary inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index for all areas measured per cent and per cent in july and august decrease in the inflation in august was mainly the result of changes in the and utilities and transport having reached a recent high of per in january and the measure of core which excludes fuel and measured per down from per cent in price inflation for final manufactured goods increased from per cent in to per cent in down from per cent in the upward trend is to continue in the coming months as the impact of higher agricultural crop food prices becomes more inflation forecast of the bank has changed with a near term and a slight medium term inflation is now expected to per cent in from per cent and then to breach the end of the target range in the first quarter of with a peak of per cent per inflation is then expected to be around the top end of the range with a further temporary breach of per cent in the final this is mainly due to base effects from the lower starting point for the petrol price the fourth quarter of this the forecast for follows a slow downward with inflation measuring per cent in the final the changes in this are mainly due to the more depreciated starting point for the real effective which is offset to some extent by a lower international oil price forecast for core inflation is marginally higher in the later but with an expected average of per cent in and slightly higher at per in up from per expectations as measured by the survey conducted in the third quarter by bureau for economic research are more or less unchanged and

the breakeven inflation rates derived the bonds have increased moderately since the previous and have remained above the upper end of the target range across all global economic outlook has become more uncertain since the previous meeting the mpc driven in part by the strong financial market reactions to the deteriorating for the chinese although the growth prospects in the us remain they have been clouded by the growing concerns about possible spillbacks a slowdown in emerging particularly in as well as from the of the strong euro area growth moderated in the second quarter and relatively while real output in japan concerns of the risk of an abrupt slowdown in the chinese economy have fuelled by excess capacity in the real estate market and in the industrial sectors the the recent equity market the surprise devaluation of the and the uncertain policy responses have added to these while date the actual slowdown has been relatively a hard landing could have severe impact on global and on commodity prices in developments have had an adverse effect on the outlook for commodity particularly emerging market but asian economies with close links with china have also been the deteriorating terms of trade have the impact of continued capital flows from emerging markets in of us monetary policy consensus growth forecasts for latin american and asian economies have accordingly been revised commodity prices have contributed to a more benign global inflation although some emerging markets are experiencing inflationary through depreciating in the united concerns about the restraining effect of the appreciating dollar on domestic economic activity coupled with global financial market volatility and the risks of a sharp in emerging markets were key factors in the decision to delay the of monetary policy the ecb has indicated that monetary easing is being contemplated while developments in japan suggest monetary policies will remain highly accommodative for some financial including bond and equity have not been to the turmoil in global although the rand has been one of the more having fluctuated in a range of between around and just against the us dollar since the previous mpc its trend over the year has not been significantly different to those of other currencies and a number of other peer emerging since the meeting of the the rand has depreciated by about per cent against us by about per cent against the euro and by about per cent on a rand was negatively impacted by developments in continued speculation the timing of us policy and the gdp the rand reacted positively to the us decision to maintain its policy as well as to the narrowing deficit on the current account of the balance of rand exchange rate remains an upside risk to the inflation as noted in a key uncertainty for the mpc is the extent to which the us normalisation is already priced into the the fact that the rand in response to the fed decision suggests that some depreciation is likely us rates are the extent is with the possibility of temporary overshoot in a highly volatile further uncertainty relates to the sustainability of the contraction in the current of the balance of payments in the second quarter when a deficit of per of gdp was while this narrowing is attributed in part to temporary there appears to be some evidence that both export and import volumes are to the depreciation of the rand and the weaker the expects this process of adjustment to remain with the export response by a number of factors including headwinds from the slowing global electricity supply constraints and declining tourism domestic economic growth outlook deteriorated compared with the previous this follows the surprise annualised contraction of per cent in the quarter of this while the mpc is of the view that a further contraction is in the third the outlook remains relatively weak amid declining and consumer the forecast for growth has been down by half a percentage point in each year of the forecast to cent in and to per cent and per cent in the subsequent two estimate of potential output for has also been revised down to the risks to the growth

particularly evident in the sectors the with contractions in mining and although in the services sectors also the agricultural sector remains by the continuing and although mining output increased in

the but trends are expected to be with average nominal wage growth in excess of inflation to the persistence of inflation at higher food price developments have been relatively they remain a to the mpc with the expectation of an acceleration in the coming months as impact of the drought feeds through to consumer this is despite the impact of falling prices at the global domestic food price inflation at consumer level appears to have reached a low point of per cent in marginally to per cent in july and the pressures are expected come from the increases in agricultural price inflation for cereals crops which increased at a rate of per cent in recent decline in international oil prices has provided some respite to inflation with the price of brent crude oil currently trading at around per lower than at the time of the previous mpc the current global of crude oil coupled with the slowdown in china is expected to keep oil contained in the short to medium the mpc revised down its oil price by between and per barrel in each of the coming the committee assesses the risk to the oil price assumption to be on the particularly in the short the domestic petrol price declined by a per litre in august and and current trends suggest that significant change is likely in with the weaker rand offsetting the impact the falling dollar price of inflation outlook remains a concern for the monetary policy with the to the forecast assessed to be on the although two breaches of the are now expected in the first and fourth quarters of next year they are to be temporary and primarily the result of base effects from lower petrol four quarters the monetary policy committee is concerned that the trajectory remains uncomfortably close to the upper end of the target given the upside risks to the probability of a more extended breach currently forecast is relatively a sustained breach of the target range has danger that it could impact negatively on inflation expectations which are sticky at the upper end of the target mpc is also concerned about domestic growth with the economy in the second growth is expected to remain constrained by developments and associated uncertainty and low business and confidence and electricity supply domestic inflation is not by demand and the outlook for household consumption expenditure we have to be mindful of the effects of shocks on are a number of upside risks to the inflation the primary one being the rate which has already depreciated significantly against the advanced currencies in response to global and is still likely to react to the commencement of us monetary policy a further risk from possible higher increases in electricity tariffs from the of next risks to the inflation outlook include international oil prices should they be at current in weak domestic demand may continue to pricing power in the the committee nevertheless assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be on the noted in previous the mpc has to achieve a fine balance between its core mandate and not undermining short term growth the mpc unanimously decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now at per per mpc remains on a gradual policy normalisation the committee will to monitor developments and will not hesitate to act appropriately the risks to the inflation outlook deteriorate as any future remain highly data since the previous meeting of the monetary policy domestic inflation has moderated and is expected to decline further over the coming at the same the south african economy has been affected by the significant global slowdown that has intensified the domestic economy experienced negligible growth in the third while a number of sectors while there has been some improvement in the inflation risks posed by uncertainty with regard to the exchange rate in data releases over the past weeks have shown that the international economy is slowing down faster than previously expected and that global inflation pressures are this has resulted in the recent global interventions by policy monetary policy remains guided by local monetary policy always takes into consideration the possible impacts of global developments on the south african economy in general and on inflation in developments in inflation inflation excluding mortgage interest measured per cent in august and subsequently declined to increases of per cent and per cent in september and petrol and electricity prices were the main contributors to the inflation despite the petrol price reductions in september and food prices increased at a rate of per cent in while petrol and electricity prices increased by per cent over the same if food and petrol were cpix inflation would have measured per cent in compared to per cent in price

agricultural food prices declined for the third successive month in october when the rate declined to per manufactured food prices increased by per cent in compared with per cent in outlook for most recent central forecast of the bank shows a further improvement in the inflation outlook since the previous mpc with an unchanged stance of monetary inflation is expected to continue its downward and to return to within the inflation target range in the third quarter of inflation is expected then marginally to breach the upper end of the target range in the first quarter of as a result of technical base effects associated with the decline in petrol prices at the end of the downward inflation trend is forecast to continue is expected to average per cent and per cent in and respectively and to average per cent in the final quarter of the forecasts are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than given the highly volatile global and the uncertainty related to the impact of the rebasing and reweighting of the cpi basket to be introduced by statistics south africa in january expectations as measured by the yield differential between conventional government bonds and bonds declined from just over per cent in july to around per cent in early the yield curve has remained inverted at the longer end and has declined since the previous particularly in the year maturity

to the declines in the agricultural food component of the producer price index mentioned and to the significant fall in domestic spot prices of maize and despite the depreciation of the rand over the past food price increases at the consumer price level remain but the spot price developments are expected to impact on these prices in the coming economic growth rate also declined significantly in

expected protracted slowdown is likely to lower prices of other goods as as the pricing power of firms the possible stimulus to growth provided by more accommodative monetary policies and fiscal stimuli are likely to take some time to filter given the fragile state of the banking systems and the marked declines in business and consumer policy monetary policy committee considered recent developments in the south african economy and the risks to the inflation outlook against the backdrop of conditions prevailing in the global economy and international financial the mpc has noted improvements in the inflation outlook in south africa since its previous meeting in october however risks to the inflation outlook remain and will be monitored the mpc has therefore decided to reduce

upper end of the inflation target range for four quarters in response to rate and wage countervailing risks are also while there is a risk that food prices may faster in the near the longer term forecast assumes that food prices stabilise by year allowing for favourable base effects next food particularly decline in response to a normalisation of a much sharper downward food inflation trajectory could absence of demand and risks to consumption expenditure growth also contribute to downside increase in the repo rate at the previous mpc meeting contributed to the in the inflation and that move should be seen in with previous actions in the cycle and the lagged effects of monetary the mpc felt that there is some room to pause in this tightening cycle and decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged for now at per cent five members preferred no while one member preferred a point mpc remains focused on its inflation but sensitive to the extent to the state of the the mpc will not hesitate to act appropriately the inflation dynamics require a within a flexible inflation targeting future as will continue to be highly data the last meeting of the monetary policy committee the rate of inflation has slowed down further to a level just above the upper limit of the inflation target the sharp decline in inflation in the first half of has been a major accomplishment of the prudent monetary policy stance adopted during combined with the recovery in the external value of the the increase in interest rates in served to contain inflation and inflationary aggregate production began to grow at a slower rate from the middle of although aggregate domestic demand continued to increase supported by government sections of the business sector have experienced some pressure on their earnings and profitability largely as a consequence of a reduction in inflation rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds slowed down further in may and june the rate of increase in the which had decelerated from a peak of per cent in november to per cent in april came down to per cent in although this slower growth was largely a result of a lower rate of increase in food prices and an actual decline in fuel the prices of other consumer goods and services also increased at a slower the rate of increase in the cpix excluding food and energy prices amounted to per cent in june compared to per cent in november from quarter to quarter at seasonally adjusted and annualised there was an even more significant decline in cpix inflation from per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the second quarter of in the prices of a number of categories of consumer goods and such as grain transport goods and reading actually declined in the second quarter of the stickiness in the prices of services when inflation began to the seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of increase in the prices of all services slowed down from per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the second quarter of measured on a the inflation in services amounted to per cent in june this still high rate of inflation was mainly due to the low level of the base for growth calculations in the preceding in the production price index fell back considerably from a peak rate of per cent in september to per cent in may but then rose slightly to per cent in the latter rise in production prices could mainly be attributed to an increase in electricity tariffs for the winter and probably will have only a temporary effect on domestic from quarter to the overall production price index has declined in both the first and second quarters of this decline was to a large extent related to the recovery in the external value of the rand and low inflation rates in south main trading partner which brought about a decrease in the prices of imported goods throughout the first half of the prices of domestically produced food products also declined in the first two quarters of despite this actual decline in production prices of the consumer prices of most types of food are still albeit at low the full advantage of the lower food prices has therefore not as yet been passed on to the inflation only did the inflation outcome improve over the past two but the inflation outlook generally remains most commentators and economists expect inflation to come down over the short term and to remain at this lower level over the long the expected further improvement in inflation is confirmed by the decrease in the inflation measured as the difference between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on expected inflation derived in this way has decreased from per cent in february to per cent in april and per cent in number of other developments also favour a further decline in consumer price the fiscal discipline applied by government has materially contributed to the lowering of inflation in the immediate past and will continue to be supportive of monetary policy in the the recovery in the external value of the rand favours future moderate price increases in south the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has increased by approximately per cent in the first seven months of even after this the level of the real effective exchange rate of the rand was still below the index values in early leaving domestic producers in a more competitive situation in export markets than at the turn of the the generally low inflation in the rest of the world is assisting south africa in combating domestic in international oil markets are somewhat more the slowdown in aggregate production has led to a decline in the utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing from per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of it seems unlikely that capacity constraints will arise in the near future taking the international and domestic economic conditions into the inflation outlook generally still seems to be there are certain developments in the domestic economy which require the monetary policy committee to remain of particular concern were the recent wage settlement rates of around per nearly all the salary and wage increases in have been above the current inflation rate and have been negotiated in an environment of declining high nominal unit labour costs will therefore inevitably put pressure on price in high rates of increase in some administered prices are also a cause for development in the domestic economy which could lead to increasing inflation pressures has been the continued strong aggregate domestic demand for goods and national accounts statistics are not yet available for the second quarter of many such as wholesale and retail trade at constant new and used vehicle real value of buildings completed and electricity signal that domestic final demand was sustained at a relatively high level in the first half of strong performance of domestic demand combined with a slowdown in total domestic have led to a reversal in the balance on the current account of the balance of payments from a surplus to a deficit of about per cent of gross domestic product in the first quarter of in the second quarter of a moderate decline in merchandise imports could not neutralise a much larger fall in this caused the trade balance to shrink from a seasonally adjusted and annualised value of billion in the first quarter of to billion in the second the consequent larger current account deficit was financed by inflows on the financial account without putting any significant pressure on the exchange rate of the going forward if the current account continues to behave in the same fashion it could lead to pressure on domestic high domestic demand in the first half of has been financed to some extent by means of bank the growth in underlying bank credit extension to the private sector private sector credit extension excluding investments and bills amounted to per cent in june compared with per cent in december the growth rate in underlying bank credit extension to the private sector rose even more sharply from per cent in the first quarter of to per cent in the second money supply has also recently although the growth rate of the broadly defined money supply has remained at levels in the first six months of the momentum of growth in has accelerated considerably over the past three this is clearly reflected in the annualised growth rate in which rose from per cent in the first quarter of to per cent in the second policy developments clearly demonstrate that a careful balance needs to be struck in the determination of monetary the welcome fall in and the prospect going forward that inflation will remain in line with the target range of per gives scope for an easing of the monetary policy but against that there needs to be balanced the continuing buoyancy of final domestic and the risks to inflation from the specific sources of cost pressures identified taking all this into account the monetary policy committee has decided to reduce the repo rate by basis points to a level of per cent effective from august the course of any future movements in the repo in either will continue to be judged by the committee in the light of the outlook for inflation against the inflation rate of cpix inflation has remained well within the target range of per cent for the past eight from september to april despite increases in international oil in general most factors favour a continuation of inflation within this range and inflation expectations have generally recent evidence indicates that there has been an acceleration in economic south africa has now experienced eighteen consecutive quarters of economic this being the longest upward phase of the business cycle on inflation rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds decreased from per cent in october and november to per cent in both march and april although these latest rates of inflation are marginally above the rate of per cent in december they have remained well within the inflation target rates of increase over twelve months in the prices of consumer goods have been below the lower limit of the inflation target range since october and amounted to per cent in april by prices of consumer services continued to increase at rates of around per cent over this same period and only recently came down to per cent in april increases in administered prices were mainly responsible for the continued high increases in the prices of from quarter to quarter and adjusted for seasonal cpix inflation accelerated from an annualised rate of per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of seasonally adjusted and the increase in the cpix amounted to per cent in these higher rates could mainly be attributed to increases in the prices of alcoholic beverages and and were related to increases in international oil prices and excise addition to the monetary and fiscal discipline applied by the the steadier performance of the exchange rate of the rand has continued to contribute to the maintenance of price improved agricultural conditions from the beginning of also assisted in moderating consumer food price the prices of fresh meat started to rise rapidly in the first four months of together with increases in the rates charged for gas and water and international oil this contributed to a reversal in the rate of decline in the production price while production prices continued to decrease in the first four months of the rate of decline slowed down from per cent in november to per cent in april this was mainly due to an increase in the change in prices of domestically produced goods from per cent to per cent over the same however the prices of imported goods declined further at relatively high rates in the first four months of inflation the short developments in international oil through their impact on domestic fuel are likely to be a source of upwards pressure on the monthly average spot price of brent crude oil increased from us per barrel in april to us per barrel in may and on some days exceeded us per geopolitical uncertainties together with a strong growth in a curtailment of production and the of strategic stocks were mainly responsible for this price over the short the announced intention to increase oil production of opec countries in july and august should hopefully help to reduce prices below recent peak but it is unclear whether prices will fall back fully to the opec target over the medium to longer oil demand and supply are expected to be more or less in balance which could lead to a correction in international this background and taking all other factors into it is possible that rates of increase in the cpix could temporarily breach the upper level of the target band towards the end of and the early part of any such breach is expected to be with the likelihood that cpix inflation will return to within the range shortly further the inflation outlook generally remains favourable and inflation expectations also support this a sharp rise in international commodity world inflation is expected to remain at low the international monetary fund forecasts that the annual percentage change in global consumer prices will decline from per cent in to per cent in this lower inflation is forecast within an environment of continued world economic growth notwithstanding current higher international oil rate of increase in domestic production picked up in the first quarter of faster growth in output is likely to be sustained throughout this year and given the strength of domestic for the domestic producers still have considerable excess production so that at present pressures arising from supply constraints do not appear to be having a marked effect on domestic production price the growth rate of total real gross domestic fixed capital formation amounted to per cent in and preliminary information indicates that it continued to grow at a high rate in the first quarter of government in its latest budget projected the borrowing requirement as a ratio of gross domestic product to rise somewhat from per cent in fiscal to per cent in fiscal the budget proposals also indicated that this is intended to be a temporary it is envisaged that this ratio will decline again to per cent in fiscal clearly demonstrating the determination of the government to preserve fiscal recent announcements by the government indicate a greater determination to take active steps to moderate administered price increases within the context of inflation the exception of meat and deciduous fruit the outlook for most other food prices generally seems to be meat prices usually rise with improved agricultural conditions when farmers postpone the marketing of the prices of deciduous fruit will probably be affected by the current low rainfall in the western favourable agricultural conditions in the rest of the country should help to contain increases in other food final demand continued to increase substantially in the first quarter of as substantiated by indicators such as retail the sales of motor vehicles and credit extension to the impact of the increase in domestic expenditure on south trade balance was moderated somewhat by the acceleration in the growth of domestic as a the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is likely to be smaller than was the case in the fourth quarter of estimates suggest that this deficit was more than fully financed by a surplus on the financial including unrecorded these transactions enabled the reserve bank to increase its gross international reserves further from us billion at the end of december to us billion at the end of march at the end of may these reserves stood at about us in view of these developments the external value of the rand has been more stable in the first five months of than in the preceding three in money supply and total loans and advances of banks remains fairly brisk while the income velocity of circulation was at a historically low level of in the first quarter of the growth rate in the broadly defined increased from per cent in december to per cent in february before coming down to per cent in growth in total loans and advances of around per cent was recorded from april to march in april this growth receded to per mainly on account of high base increase in the average nominal remuneration per worker amounted to per cent in and wage settlements in collective bargaining agreements are predicted to average between and per cent for although this indicates a declining trend when compared with the rate of increase in labour remuneration per worker of about per cent in it is still considerably in excess of productivity nominal unit labour cost accordingly continued to increase at high particularly disconcerting is the fact that nominal unit labour cost in manufacturing enterprises rose by as much as per cent in this could give rise to inflationary pressures in domestic production policy the factors into in particular the risks to the inflation together with further increases in domestic the monetary policy committee has nevertheless decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at per cent per the monetary policy committee will continue to monitor all the risk factors to the inflation if the outlook the committee will review its the global economy continues to be in the midst of a severe synchronised

the most recent central forecast of the bank shows a deterioration in the inflation outlook but inflation is expected to follow a downward trend and to average per cent at the end of the forecast

outlook to emanate from particularly administered which include the risk of electricity tariff food price inflation at the consumer price which has remained relatively unresponsive to lower inflation at the producer price appears to show signs of should this downward trend it could have a significant downward impact on the inflation monetary policy the monetary policy committee considered the severe synchronised downturn in international and domestic economic conditions and noted their potential future downward impact on notwithstanding the recent domestic inflation the committee is of the view that the adverse economic conditions continue to tilt the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to the downside over the medium term and has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by basis points to per cent per annum with effect from may the prospects for inflation returning to within the inflation target range by the second quarter of remain domestic demand conditions continue to be subdued and currently do not pose a significant threat to the inflation economic growth is expected to improve in the coming but is likely to remain below potential for some domestic growth prospects are dependent to an extent on the global recovery which appears to be uneven across countries and however the inflation outlook has been affected adversely by possible further significant adjustments to electricity recent developments in has been no publication of consumer price index data since the previous meeting of the monetary policy committee the most recent data showed that the inflation rate as measured by the cpi for all urban areas declined to per cent in compared with per cent in the main contributors to the inflation outcome were the categories of housing and and miscellaneous goods and prices declined at a rate of per cent in compared with a decline of per cent in food price inflation at the producer price level continues to signal dissipating pressures on food prices at the consumer price agricultural product prices declined at a rate of per cent while manufactured food product prices increased at a rate of per upside pressure on producer prices came from electricity prices which increased by per the outlook for cpi inflation forecast by the south african reserve bank staff continues to indicate that inflation is likely to return to within the inflation target on a sustained by the second quarter of cpi inflation is then expected to stay within the inflation target range for the rest of the forecast period until the end of compared with the previous the outlook showed a slight improvement for and mainly as a result of the changed assumption regarding the rand exchange no adjustment has been made at this stage to the central forecast for

industrialised the timing and speed of the withdrawal of the fiscal and monetary policy stimuli may have a bearing on the nature of the recovery in these global inflation is expected to be constrained by the relatively weak demand from the industrialised although the us dollar movements may provide some upward pressure to commodity are some positive indications that the rate of contraction of the domestic economy has declined and that the economy may emerge from the recession by the end of the mixed picture from the published data shows that the recovery is likely to be and the output gap is likely to remain positive for some the physical volume of manufacturing output declined at a rate of per cent in and by per cent on a in the three months to compared with the previous three an increase of per cent was the purchasing managers index increased markedly from index points in august to index points in the index shows that new sales orders have increased while expectations of business conditions six months ahead improved to the highest level since early sectoral developments indicate that the physical volume of total mining production increased in the three months to august but contracted on a whilst the real value of building plans passed continued to the business confidence indicator declined to a low in the third quarter of the tentative nature of the domestic recovery is also reflected in the composite leading business cycle indicator compiled by the south african reserve bank which declined marginally in following three consecutive monthly expenditure by households also remains with real retail trade sales declining at a rate of per cent in in the three months to there was a per cent compared with the previous three wholesale trade sales also declined further in total new vehicle sales are also well below their levels of a year however there are indications that the negative trend may have reached its lower turning point with zero or slightly positive rates of change being recorded on a and the consumer confidence index declined in the third quarter of to a relatively neutral confidence extension to the private sector continued to reflect both the weak household consumption expenditure and the prevailing tighter credit the ernst and young financial services index indicates that credit standards applied by retail banks to loan

uncertainties impart a downside risk to the domestic economic growth outlook which remains relatively the turbulence in the financial markets has caused the rand to but the associated risk to the

this highly volatile and uncertain environment the mpc is of the view that it is appropriate to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy given the continued absence of clear signs of excess

pressures on food prices at the retail level in coming sea brent crude oil is currently trading at around per which is similar to prices prevailing at the time of the previous mpc during july the

sustained slowdown in household consumption expenditure the consumer confidence index still remains near record levels despite a moderate decline in the second quarter of retail sales growth remains

measured per cent in in the first half of wage settlement rates have averaged per but a growing number of recent settlements have been closer to per this may still be consistent with the inflation target if labour productivity growth is accounted nevertheless the upward trend is of some concern given the importance of wage developments in the price formation a result of the uncertainties in the international financial markets and the strengthening of the us the rand exchange rate has depreciated particularly over the past few before the onset of the current round of global financial market the rand had appreciated due to amongst others the weakness in the us dollar against other and anticipated capital inflows related to possible merger and acquisition at one stage the rand had reached levels slightly below at a time when the us dollar had reached an historic low against the however the increased global risk aversion and a recovery in the us dollar reversed this trend and the rand

productive capacity in the manufacturing sector increased to per cent in the second the business confidence index declined marginally in the second quarter of a more positive outlook is provided by the purchasing managers index which increased in july following three consecutive monthly despite some negative growth is expected to be underpinned in the coming months by the continued acceleration in the growth of real gross fixed capital formation which increased at a rate of almost per cent in the first quarter of and brought the ratio of fixed capital formation to gdp to over per this stage there is no evidence that the recent turbulence in the international financial markets will have marked effects on the domestic growth although this will depend to some extent on the impact of these

monetary policy stance is required in order to ensure that cpix inflation returns to within the target the repo rate is adjusted by basis points to per cent per annum with effect from august the mpc will continue to monitor the relevant economic and financial developments in order to ensure that its mandate is since the previous meeting of the monetary policy committee there has been some improvement in global financial market but economic growth prospects in a number of the major advanced economies or regions remain downside risks to the outlook persist as the structural problems in many and in the eurozone in are still monetary policy in most countries is likely to remain accommodative in the absence of clear evidence of a sustained particularly against the backdrop of a relatively benign global inflation a generally positive reaction to the anc elective ongoing labour the proposed scaling down of mining operations and ratings agency downgrades are symptomatic of the challenging domestic in the absence of coherent and consistent structural policy initiatives domestic economic growth is expected to continue to be well below both what is possible and required to make significant inroads into in contrast to the situation in most advanced the risks to the inflation outlook remain on the due in large part to continued exchange rate and wage cost inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index for all urban areas was per cent in december up from per cent in the categories of food and housing and and transport together accounted for percentage points of the inflation food price inflation moderated from per cent in november to per mainly as a result of lower meat and grain price core as measured by the exclusion of petrol and electricity from which

inflation is now expected to average per cent in and per cent in compared with the previous forecasts of per cent and per cent for the respective inflation is expected to peak at per cent in the third

an expectation of some contraction in the negative business sentiment evident in the confidence indicators is also reflected in the continued weakness in private sector gross fixed capital recent

moderation in the growth of expenditure on durable and and the depreciated exchange rate is likely to sustain this growth in motor vehicle sales has slowed in recent and there was a marked decline in the confidence of new vehicle traders reported by the despite the increase in retail trade sales in the quarterly rates suggest further moderation in the consumer confidence index declined by index points to index points in the final quarter of the mpc does not assess growth in household consumption expenditure to be excessive or to pose significant inflationary and further moderation is factors that affect the outlook for consumption both positively and include concerns regarding wage credit extension particularly unsecured and administered price increases which impact on discretionary

household debt to disposable income appears to have stabilised at around per mpc remains concerned about the potential impact of the higher level of wage settlements on employment and there are indications that wage increases are trending with growth in nominal remuneration per worker increasing from per cent in the second quarter of to per cent in the third once productivity increases are accounted this translates into unit labour cost increases of per cent and per cent in these respective according to andrew levy employment the overall average wage settlement rate in collective bargaining agreements amounted to per cent in the first nine months of mpc is mindful of the danger of a possible spiral and further employment losses should unaffordable real wage demands be granted while economic growth remains the risk to inflation should this scenario play itself out are significant in the absence of productivity subdued pace of employment creation in the private sector has been further undermined by the fractious nature of recent wage negotiations and the announcement of further possible restructuring in the mining sector which would involve the closure or mothballing of mines or according to the quarterly employment statistics survey of statistics south formal sector employment grew by per cent or employees in the year to september almost two thirds of this increase was accounted for by the public while net job losses over this period were experienced in the manufacturing and construction with employment in the mining sector in the third quarter of jobs were shed in the mining sector and there are fears that this trend could employment in the agricultural which is not covered by the is also at prices continue to pose a significant risk to the inflation although there are signs that these price pressures may moderate during the year as a result of favourable base as well as the recent moderation in global and domestic wheat and maize the price of these commodities will also be influenced by developments in the exchange rate of the rand and unpredictable weather prices remain on average well in excess of the upper end of the target and there is as yet no clarity about the new eskom tariffs to be implemented later this at this stage a per cent tariff increase is assumed in the international oil prices have remained relatively stable for the past few months and are more or less unchanged from the previous meeting of the futures prices reflect an expectation of some moderation in coming but some volatility can be the domestic price of which is also impacted by the exchange declined by a cumulative cents per litre since early but much of this decline is likely to be reversed in mpc continues to assess the balance of risks to the inflation outlook to be on the while the risks to the forecast emanating from food prices may have diminished particularly over the medium the exchange rate and wage settlements remain the key upside risk while the reweighting and rebasing of the cpi is still to be the impact is likely to be but on the core inflation trends indicate that demand pressures are relatively and household consumption expenditure has continued to to economic growth are assessed to be on the particularly given the uncertain outlook for the mining industry and ongoing unsettled labour the negative output gap is therefore expected to the mpc remains concerned about the possibility of a spiral and its potential to exacerbate the high level of unemployment in the as we noted in the previous mpc concerted action is needed on the part of all the parties we need cohesion of policy and decision making to provide the necessary certainty for sustainable economic growth and monetary policy stance remains accommodative and with the real policy rate remaining slightly notwithstanding the expected temporary breach of the inflation further accommodation at this stage is constrained by the upside risks to the inflation the mpc has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at per cent per as the mpc will monitor developments closely and will not hesitate to act in a manner consistent with its since the previous meeting of the monetary policy the outlook for domestic inflation and economic growth has posing a serious challenge for monetary policy going inflation is now expected to remain above the upper end of the target range for a more extended but there is still no evidence of significant demand pressures in the economic growth in the fourth quarter was likely to have exceeded that in the previous two the forecast for growth in has been revised the primary reason for the worsening domestic growth outlook is the risk of contagion from the persistent crisis in which

important driver of and increases of per cent are assumed for both and the current nersa determination ends in and subsequent price increases are yet to be the case for further significant increases is the determination of administered prices should not act as an inhibitor to growth and oil prices have been subject to conflicting downside pressures have emanated from the weaker global growth while upside pressures emanate from factors which have raised fears of possible supply nevertheless the price of brent crude oil has been surprisingly stable despite some is at similar levels to those prevailing at the time of the previous meeting of the domestic petrol prices decreased by a cumulative cents per litre since early but the current suggests that a further increase can be expected in

there are indications that the downward trend in nominal remuneration may have according to statistics south growth in average remuneration per worker increased by per cent in the third quarter of

global economic mpc remains of the view that inflation pressures are primarily of a but is concerned that a persistent upward trend in inflation and prolonged breach of the inflation target could have an adverse effect on inflation expectations which could reinforce the upward inflation the mpc is also cognisant of the slowing domestic economy and feels that given the lack of demand monetary tightening at this stage would not be at the same the nominal policy rate is at a long term low and the real policy rate is slightly indicating a monetary policy stance that is accommodative and supportive of the real mpc maintains a preference for a stable interest rate environment given the conflicting pressures on monetary policy at this however the committee will continue to monitor

spreads on emerging market inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds increased at a rate of per cent in

categories continue to exhibit low rates of price while the categories of clothing and footwear and furniture and equipment have shown persistent price services price inflation has declined

recent central forecast of the bank projects inflation to peak above the per cent level and to remain outside the target range for the first two quarters of based on the current cpix inflation is projected to decline slowly to reach a level marginally above per cent by the end of seems to us that the use of the forecast in monetary policy decisions needs to be further the mpc does not use the forecast in a mechanical way as the basis for policy the forecast provides a broad guide to possible inflation but the committee relies on its judgement about possible future no model can adequately capture all the relevant dynamic processes in any it is worth emphasising that the model outcomes are also dependent on the assumptions that are fed into the mpc takes a view of the risks to the exchange rate has exhibited considerable and fluctuated between levels of around and to the us dollar since the june mpc the behaviour of the rand was initially related to increased global risk combined with concerns relating to domestic balance of payments more expectations that the monetary policy tightening cycle globally may be at or near its peak have prompted an appreciation of the rand to current levels of around on a the rand has depreciated by about per cent since the beginning of the and by per cent since the previous mpc some from the exchange rate to prices can be

of higher domestic expenditure and are not in themselves there is however a possible risk to the exchange rate if the deficits are perceived to be particularly if the deficits are reflecting higher consumption the recent exchange rate reaction to the higher deficit is indicative of but it is also part of the macroeconomic adjustment in order for the exchange rate to play its part in this it is

the growth in consumer expenditure and higher property growth over twelve months in total loans and advances accelerated from per cent in may to per cent in asset backed credit which accounts for a significant part of the increase in total loans and has remained around per cent since february recently wage developments presented a benign during unit labour cost in the formal sector increased by per providing further evidence that wage pressures were well however in the first quarter of nominal unit labour cost increased by per cent compared to the same quarter of the previous and up from an increase of per cent in the fourth quarter of this development is attributed in part to a decline in labour productivity in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter last as employment outpaced output it is too early to tell if this represents a reversal of the previous but as a significant number of wage negotiations are concluded in the third these developments will be closely wage settlements surveys conducted by andrew levy employment publications show that settlements have averaged per cent in the first half of compared to per cent in as a indications are that economic

the growing vulnerability of the economy to changes in sentiment has been reflected in the depreciating and volatile exchange which was already under pressure from the widening deficit on the current

inflation outlook has deteriorated mainly as a result of external demand conditions remain relatively and are not seen to pose a significant risk to the inflation outlook at this however there are elevated risks that these external price shocks could ultimately feed through to more generalised domestic economic recovery has been although still at relatively moderate nor are there signs of a significant increase in the international outlook remains and the economic recovery has become more hesitant in the past in the wake of renewed concerns about peripheral the earthquake in japan and

consolidation and risks posed by higher commodity prices which have the potential to destabilise inflation and unemployment has also remained persistently high in a number of industrialised notably in the united states and spending in europe in particular has been constrained in part by the undercapitalisation of a significant portion of the banking there are heightened concerns about the ability of some of the peripheral european particularly ireland and to meet their debt obligations and this poses a systemic risk to the lower growth in japan and the disruption to the global supply chain

main risks to the inflation outlook continue to emanate from cost push including administered the acceleration in food price inflation is expected to persist for some despite indications that global food price inflation may have international oil price has also displayed a marked degree of volatility in the past when prices fell by as much as in one having risen sharply over recent weeks the price of oil reached a peak of around per the price of brent crude oil has fallen and is about per barrel lower than that prevailing at the time of the previous mpc while international oil prices are not expected to decline further in the near it is unclear if prices will consolidate at current or if they will continue on their upward in the past two months the domestic petrol price has increased by per and by per cent since the beginning of the mpc continues to be of the view that the underlying inflation pressures are mainly of a cost push these developments are expected to result in a temporary breach of the upper limit of the target band during the first quarter of it is recognised that these pressures have the real potential to generate second round effects which can result in more generalised light of the the mpc has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at per cent per for the time given the upside risks to the inflation the mpc will monitor closely any indications of second round effects on inflation emanating from these cost the mpc will not hesitate to respond timeously to signs that threaten to move inflation out of the target range on a sustained in the mpc will remain vigilant with respect to any inflation risks that could emanate from domestic demand inflation rate of inflation has declined further since the last meeting of the monetary policy in particular production price inflation slowed down to low changes in production which generally precede similar changes in consumer fell back from a peak rate of increase of per cent in september to per cent in january and to per cent in in fact the production price index measured from quarter to quarter declined at a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of per cent in the first quarter of while it had increased by per cent in the fourth quarter of and by per cent in the first quarter of the recovery of the moderating food price inflation and a disciplined monetary policy stance eased price more significant is that the decline in production prices was not only confined to lower prices of imported goods related to the recovery in the external value of the but the prices of domestically produced goods also declined at an annualised rate of per cent in the first quarter of all the categories of domestically produced goods experienced disinflation in the first quarter of prices of imported goods declined at an annualised rate of per cent in the first quarter of revised consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds also improved the rate of increase in the cpix decelerated from a peak of per cent in november to per cent in february and per cent in cpix inflation declined at a faster pace from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of the figures not been the quarter to quarter annualised rate of growth in the cpix would have amounted to per cent in the first quarter of measured over a period of twelve months the revision of the cpix was also the turning point and pattern of change between the previous and revised monthly series coincide fairly factors favouring lower a number of developments favour a reduction in the inflation inflation in the rest of the global inflation is generally expected to remain low and consumer prices in advanced economies could even reach an average rate below per cent in the sluggish world economic performance and weak household could promote continuing disinflationary recovery in the external value of the the nominal value of the effective exchange rate of the rand increased by per cent during the year up to the end of december and by a further per cent in the first five months of although the effect of the recovery of the rand is usually much smaller than in the case of a the current available information indicates that some of the direct and indirect effects of the changed external value of the rand have already benefited disinflation in the ending of the war in the end of the war in iraq and the fact that oil supplies were not materially has removed some of the uncertainties about the international economic tensions in the middle east the surge in the average oil price per barrel from in november to in february came to an abrupt end at the beginning of the iraq brent crude oil prices then dropped to an average of per barrel in together with the recovering this decline in oil prices led to a considerable reduction in domestic fuel prices in may and june which should also assist in bringing the rate of inflation down to lower in inflation the recent survey by the bureau of economic research of the university of stellenbosch clearly indicates that inflation expectations of labour and households are a decline in inflation expectations is also indicated by a decrease in the inflation rate measured as the difference between the nominal yield on conventional bonds and the real yield on expected inflation derived in this way has decreased from per cent in february to just below per cent from april inflation expectations play an important role in the inflation containment production capacity in the utilisation of production capacity in manufacturing declined to per cent in the first quarter of or to a level considerably below what would normally be regarded as full capacity a clear downward trend is also discernible in total unfilled orders at constant prices from the middle of which makes any capacity constraints unlikely in the near fiscal the government remains fully committed to pursuing sound fiscal this is demonstrated by the low level of the borrowing requirement of per cent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year and by the planning of the fiscus as presented in the medium term budget policy statement of the year although the borrowing requirement ratio is slightly higher than the ratio of per cent recorded in the fiscal year it is very low by any international government has also succeeded in reducing its debt as a ratio of gross domestic product from per cent at the end of march to per cent at the end of march monetary the rate of increase in the broadly defined money supply declined from a peak of per cent in may to per cent in march however it rose to per cent in the growth over twelve months in the claims on the domestic private excluding investments and accelerated from per cent in february to per cent in the household sector was mainly responsible for this rise in bank credit inflation pay increases continue to be a major risk factor for the containment of this risk becomes even more crucial if it is accompanied by a slowdown in labour productivity in the average nominal remuneration per worker in the formal sectors of the economy amounted to per compared with an already high per cent in over the same the growth in total labour productivity in the economy declined from per cent to per as a nominal unit labour costs in the formal sectors increased at a rate of per cent in increases at these if sustained going could jeopardise the positive inflation the relatively tight monetary the growth in final domestic demand was having increased at an average rate of per cent in the annualised rate of increase in final domestic demand amounted to per cent in the first quarter of final consumption expenditure by households increased at an annualised rate of per cent in the first quarter of or at roughly the rate attained in the preceding the steady growth in real consumption expenditure by households was possibly underpinned by the tax cuts announced in the budget of february consumers incurred debt to maintain consumption expenditure and to acquire which led to an increase in the ratio of household debt to disposable income from per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of government consumption expenditure also increased at the same pace as that recorded in the fourth quarter of in the increase in real fixed capital formation amounted to per cent in the first quarter of the growth in capital formation continued in all the sectors of the with the exception of the agricultural sector which was affected adversely by the recovering rand and in some instances by weather high growth in domestic final demand was accompanied by a marked slowdown in economic the growth in south real gross domestic product declined from an annualised rate of per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the first quarter of the further slowdown in domestic output growth was evident in all the sectors of the with a decline in the real value added of the primary and manufacturing this downward movement in economic activity can mainly be attributed to a decline in the volume of exports related to a depressed global economy and the recovery in the external value of the the level of the real effective exchange rate of the rand in the first quarter of still well below the average level in before the recent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate of the the first quarter of the current account of the balance of payments moved into a albeit to the still low level of per cent of gross domestic if the current account deficit continues to widen it could lead to pressures on domestic inflation of the likely rate of inflation for calculated by using the reserve core and other forecasting indicate that on the policy stance to the average rate of increase in the cpix will be close to the midpoint of the inflation target band in monetary policy these factors into consideration as well as the widening of the differential between south african interest rates and those of our major trading partners owing to a general decline in international interest the monetary policy committee has decided to reduce the repo rate by basis points to a level of per cent per year effective from june taking this the committee recognises the progress achieved so far in reducing inflation and the prospect that inflation may fall within the target range later this but the committee will remain vigilant to the risks going particularly those relating to wage administered prices and the uncertain outlook for the global the committee will be ready to take whatever actions are necessary in either direction in the light of the way future risks t inflation outcome during the first six months of was more favourable than had been thought to be the case at the previous meeting of the monetary policy the actual increases in the consumer price index in metropolitan and other urban areas when mortgage cost is excluded was much better than the lower combined with the recent rise in the value of the has resulted in a lower projection for cpix inflation in the next two although cpix inflation is still expected to rise over the forecast it will probably not breach the upper per cent level of the target as previously provided that the assumptions made in the projection are not too wide off the these results are expected to be achieved in combination with robust growth rates in domestic production as well as inflation rate of increase in the cpix rose from per cent in december to per cent in february before slowing down to per cent in march and remaining at that level in the next two in june cpix inflation rose to per cent mainly due to increases in petrol and diesel this was probably a temporary spike in cpix inflation because the prices of petrol and diesel were reduced in the next two if changes in petrol and diesel prices are excluded from the the rate of increase in the prices of other consumer goods and services continued to slow down from per cent in february to per cent in cpix inflation has now been within the inflation target range for a period of ten consecutive from quarter to quarter at seasonally adjusted and annualised cpix inflation declined from per cent in the first quarter of to per cent in the second the deceleration in cpix inflation was discernible in most of the main categories of consumer goods and services and the prices of certain products actually such as those of clothing and food and soft and of new and used contrast to these the running cost of and the prices of education and alcoholic drinks and tobacco rose at quarterly annualised rates in excess of per the rates of increase over twelve months in the prices of these goods and services and in the cost of medical services were also still well above the upper limit of the inflation target these high increases were largely due to changes in administered prices and indirect recent announcements by the government indicate a greater determination to moderate increases in administered prices as part of the of policies to achieve the objective of price production price index declined in the second half of to a lower level in january owing to a decline in the prices of imported goods and relatively low rates of increase in the prices of domestically produced from february this index started to move with the result that the production price inflation measured over twelve months became positive in may and amounted to per cent in the rate of increase in production seasonally adjusted and rose from per cent in the first quarter of to per cent in the second these recent increases in production prices are consistent with the expected rise in consumer prices in the coming months since consumer prices normally react to changes in the prices charged by producers with a time favourable inflation outcome was at first achieved with slower growth in the domestic growth in real gross domestic product deteriorated in and averaged only per cent for the year as a production volumes were affected by a hesitant global economic a deterioration in the international price competitiveness of domestic manufacturers and a decline in agricultural in the latter part of growth started to gather momentum and in the first quarter of amounted to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of per cent in reaction to a more accommodative monetary and fiscal policy stronger global growth and increased business and consumer such as manufacturing and mining wholesale and retail trade volumes and the number of new vehicles indicate that the economy continued to grow briskly in the second quarter of the inflation already the inflation outlook is generally promising and cpix inflation is expected to stay within the inflation target range over the next two but it could move close to the upper boundary of the target range in the second half of one of the main factors responsible for the recent and expected future low inflation is the decline in import brought about by the further rise in the external value of the rand and low global import price measured over periods of twelve has been negative since april or for a period of fifteen african import prices will be in the first by global as could be expected with the significant increase that has been experienced in international commodity prices since the beginning of consumer price inflation has started to rise in most of the major industrialised for core inflation in the united states of america increased from per cent in january to per cent in and the corresponding rate of increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices in the euro area rose from per cent in february to per cent in these increases coming from low a marked acceleration in global inflation to high levels is not particularly because of the continued strong productivity growth in some of these countries combined with a tightening in the monetary policy price inflation is also in the second on the external value of the having recovered during and from the sharp fall in the latter part of the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand increased by a further per cent until the end of july this sharp rise in the average exchange rate of the rand has distorted the planning of many enterprises in the country and has had a serious negative impact on international price competitiveness with the resultant stress being witnessed in the export earnings of manufacturing and mining at the same the exchange rate of the rand has also contributed to lower imported inflation looking to a lower prospective profile of cpix inflation within the target markets are unpredictable and so is the future performance of the exchange rate of the which is amongst other things subject to balance of payments south international trade balance has declined from a surplus at a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of about billion in the second quarter of to nearly billion in the first quarter of and a deficit of billion in the second if special factors affecting the trade balance are such as purchases of commercial aircraft and military the trade balance has remained broadly unchanged over the past three the turnaround to a negative overall trade balance did not affect the exchange rate of the rand because it was easily financed by an inflow of the future external value of the rand might depend to a large extent on the behaviour of these financial about the influence of another exogenous food has dissipated at the beginning of the monetary policy committee noted the severe drought in many parts of the combined with the rise in global food widespread rains in the area led to upward revisions of crop and shortages of maize and other grains should not negatively affect agricultural despite the heavy rains in the evidence suggests that some parts are still in the grip of a the recent reversal in global food prices should alleviate pressures that could arise from poor agricultural important positive development on the inflation front has been the declining trend of inflation expectations in the this is clearly illustrated by the survey of inflation expectations of the bureau for economic research at the university of stellenbosch undertaken on behalf of the reserve bank in the second quarter of according to this cpix inflation expectations have declined in contrast to the inflation rate calculated as the difference between the nominal yield on government bonds and the real yield on bonds within the year maturity has increased in this approximation of inflation rose from a low of per cent in december to per cent in may before declining to per cent recently in number of other factors support a positive inflation these include the low levels of utilisation of manufacturing production continued fiscal prudence and more restraint in administered price in the growth in total loans and advances extended by banks to the domestic private sector declined from a peak of per cent in february to per cent in part of this lower growth is due to disintermediation as the corporate sector is funding capital outlays and other expenditure to an increasing extent outside the banking most important risks over the short term to this positive inflation outlook are probably global exchange rate movements and increases in international oil in particular the rise in oil prices presents a major threat to inflation over the short brent crude oil prices have increased from levels of around per barrel in may to almost per barrel in may this rise in international oil prices reflected mainly ongoing geopolitical tensions in the middle east and a strong demand for oil in the united states and although oil prices declined somewhat in june to levels of around per barrel when the opec countries stated that they would increase this did not last long and at present oil prices are fluctuating around levels of per such high prices will not only have an impact on but could also neutralise to some extent the recent improvements in the global economy as well as south terms of trade and the longer the current growth in nominal unit labour cost could be a significant threat to low inflation as this growth in nominal unit labour cost rose from an average of per cent in to a rate of per cent in the first quarter of development which could have an impact on inflation over the long term is the higher rate of increase in domestic demand reflecting the reduction in interest rising real disposable income and the higher priority assigned to infrastructural national accounts statistics are not yet available for the second quarter of but available such as retail signal that domestic demand continued to increase rapidly in this in the money supply also remained relatively while the income velocity of circulation reached historically low levels in the first half of the growth rate in the money supply increased from per cent in december to per cent in february before declining to per cent in it was mainly the growth in the transaction demand for money that was responsible for the high rates of increase in during the first half of policy this the monetary policy committee took note of the moderate improvement in the outlook for inflation noted and came to the conclusion that it would be appropriate and prudent to lower the repo rate by basis points to per cent per annum with effect from friday of august the committee will continue to monitor the various factors that impact on inflation and will accordingly make any future decisions based on the inflation the inflation outlook remains relatively favourable notwithstanding some base effects that are likely adversely to affect the inflation outcomes in the domestic consumption expenditure remains under and there are no perceived risks to the inflation outlook from this despite the continued contraction of private sector gross fixed capital the domestic economic growth outlook appears to have but is expected to remain below the potential output growth for some the global economy is characterised by an uneven recovery across regions and some risks while the global inflation outlook appears to be recent developments in inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index for all urban areas declined from per cent in september to per cent and per cent in october and november the categories of housing and and miscellaneous goods and services remained the single biggest contributors to the inflation outcome in having contributed and percentage points these categories were mainly driven by electricity and insurance cost food price inflation continued to and measured per cent in while administered prices excluding petrol and paraffin increased by per primarily as a result of electricity price prices declined at rates of per cent and per cent in october and november the underlying producer price trends in the food sector remained favourable for further moderation

target range in the coming three due to technical base effects related to petrol price current forecasts indicate that inflation could measure around per cent in december and before moderating in the subsequent because of the nature of monetary the focus of the mpc is on the expected trend of the cpi inflation forecast by the south african reserve bank is predominantly unchanged since the november

final quarter of when it is forecast to average per the previous monetary policy committee eskom has modified its tariff application to the national energy regulator of south africa given the continued uncertainty related to the electricity tariff the forecast does not make provision for the full increases of per cent requested by and electricity price increases of per cent in and are the outcome of the eskom application is expected to be announced in most recent inflation expectations survey conducted by the bureau for economic research at stellenbosch university shows that in the fourth quarter of there were no significant changes in expectations compared with the previous according to the inflation is expected to average per cent in and per cent in while both business and trade union respondents continued to expect inflation to remain outside the target the forecasts of financial analysts deteriorated moderately but remained within the target the latter forecasts were in line with the reuters which in january showed that market analysts expect inflation to average per cent and per cent in and pressures on inflation have been persistently and the mpc remains of the

counteracted in part by the rand exchange rate trends and the bumper maize the exchange rate has also moderated domestic petrol price having remained relatively stable in a narrow range for the past few the price of brent crude oil has increased over the past weeks to above the per barrel resulting in a cumulative increase in domestic petrol prices of cents per litre in october and and a further increase is likely in global oil prices expected to be constrained somewhat by slow growth in the advanced monetary policy considering the prevailing conditions and it is important to emphasise that the notwithstanding any immediate impact or is on the situation that might exist to months there are significant voices and varied opinions aired in the public all expressing a view on what needs to be while it is important to listen to and hear what is being it is the responsibility of the monetary policy committee to determine the path of interest rates without fear or and this is what we will continue to monetary policy committee has taken cognisance of the improved longer term inflation outlook and assesses the risks to this outlook to be fairly evenly the domestic economic recovery remains and the adverse global developments make the growth outlook more the mpc believes that while monetary policy cannot determine the long term growth path of the it can impact on cyclical deviations of output from potential the view of the mpc is that there is room for further given the weakness in the supply side of the mpc has accordingly decided to reduce the repurchase rate by basis points to per cent per annum with effect from november this action is viewed to be consistent with the continued attainment of the inflation the scope for further downward is seen to be limited given the signs of recovery in household consumption expenditure and credit this will be assessed on an ongoing south african economy is continuing to show signs of robust growth and inflation has remained at low since the last meeting of the international oil prices have risen to new the rand exchange rate has appreciated moderately and domestic expenditure has remained oil price increases could be a major source of inflation pressure and pose the greatest risk to future inflation international perceptions of south africa have been reflected in developments during the past two the recent ratings upgrade by standard and of south external debt rating to the completion of the purchase by barclays bank plc of a controlling share in absa bank and the recent successful conclusion by the sa reserve bank with banks of a billion syndicated loan facility at far more favourable margins reflect the growing positive sentiment towards south africa by international in conjunction with the higher level of foreign exchange such developments can be expected to underpin a greater degree of stability of the macroeconomic inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds has remained within the inflation target range of per cent for the past for the past three cpix inflation has been below the market consensus in cpix inflation was per down from the per cent measured the previous the lower inflation has become increasingly and a significantly larger number of categories of goods and services are now within the inflation target prices have continued to decline in a number of including clothing and furniture and equipment and some food items such as vegetables and services inflation has been declining in recent months there is still a significant difference between goods inflation and services in for services inflation measured per cent compared to per cent for goods although the decline in services inflation has been it nevertheless compares favourably with the per cent measured in june part of the sluggishness of services inflation can be attributed to the behaviour of administered prices excluding although administered price inflation declined significantly from the middle of since it has remained relatively in may and june administered price inflation excluding petrol measured and per cent price inflation has also remained in june the percentage change over twelve months was per compared to per cent the previous although imported goods prices showed an increase from per cent to per cent from may to prices of goods produced domestically rose at a rate of per down from per cent the previous this decline was mainly a result of falling prices in the agricultural outlook for central outlook for inflation remains generally favourable and cpix inflation is expected to remain within the to per cent target range for the forecast period to the end of although the inflation rate over the past few months has been below per it is expected to increase over the next few partly as a result of the higher petrol according to our central cpix inflation will begin to rise moderately and peak in the first quarter of marginally below per whereafter it is expected to decline this is marginally higher than the previous forecast and reflects changes in oil price and exchange rate favourable inflation outlook is underpinned by a number of factors which have improved since the previous these include the low food price and producer price and the lower than expected inflation outcomes referred to the last mpc meeting there has been a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate of the at the time of the june meeting the rand was trading at a level of around to the us since then the dollar has weakened against the having reached a level below to the the dollar is currently trading at levels of around this development explains in part the strengthening of the rand exchange rate to current levels of around a further factor that contributed to the strengthening of the rand was the ratings upgrade from standard and on a the rand appreciated by per cent in the period following the last mpc although it has depreciated by per cent since the beginning of the the rand will continue to be influenced mainly by dollar which remain trend of wage settlements and unit labour costs are closely watched by the at the april meeting we commented on the divergence between wage settlement trends and unit labour cost although we would not expect these two measures to coincide they should move in broadly the same since then there has been greater consistency in the two in the first quarter of unit labour costs in the sectors increased by per compared to the first

significantly exceeded budgeted primarily as a result of corporate expenditure is broadly in line with given the volatility of expenditures and it is probably premature to draw firm conclusions about the likely fiscal outcome for the but it appears unlikely that the budgeted deficit will be developments remain broadly supportive of a favourable inflation although there are some signs of inflation pressures in a number of countries related to oil price the longer term outlook remains interest rate trends have and in interest rates in countries such as the united states have been while those in the economies have either remained as in the euro or have recently as in the united kingdom and are however a number of threats to the inflation the most significant emanates from the international oil prices which have reached new record highs in recent the monthly average spot price of brent crude oil increased from per barrel in june to in since then prices have breached the per barrel and prices for future delivery over the next three months are currently above this level as these price increases have occurred despite several increases since in the official production quotas of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries the full impact of these developments are yet to be reflected in the inflation in july and august the petrol price increased by a total of almost cents per and the current underrecovery points to a further possible increase in the recent strengthening of the rand against the dollar helped to mitigate the impact of the rise in international crude oil prices on domestic petrol gdp growth figures for the second quarter of the year are not yet indications are that the real economy has continued to grow at a robust the composite leading

international liquidity position to policy the outlook for inflation is generally favourable as described the monetary policy committee has decided that it would be inappropriate at this stage to change the monetary policy stance in view of the risks to the inflation the repo rate therefore remains unchanged at per cent per the mpc will continue as usual to monitor closely all the developments in the economy and the factors influencing and will stand ready to adjust the stance in either direction if depending on the outlook for since the previous meeting of the monetary policy committee the

possible default on greek sovereign debt sparked concerns of a contagion effect on other european economies with high fiscal deficits and debt there were also fears of a to the european banking sector which has significant exposures to the sovereign debt of these financial markets initially reacted positively to the concerted and significant policy interventions announced on may by the euro area governments and the however the markets were subsequently less convinced that the measures taken would be sufficient to resolve the underlying solvency problem of these or that the required fiscal consolidations would be politically and socially these developments demonstrate the fragility of the global and the related uncertainties pose a downside risk to the global the global inflation is expected to remain and is not expected to pose an upside risk to domestic much of the period since the previous mpc the exchange rate of the rand had remained relatively stable within a range of

period the rand has depreciated by over per cent against the us but has appreciated by around per cent against the at current levels the rand remains a positive factor in the inflation but this is contingent on developments in the euro area and general risk global developments also highlight the current focus of the financial markets on the sustainability of fiscal deficits and debt the south african national government deficit measured an estimated per cent of gdp in the fiscal compared with the projected per cent announced in the february the deficit is expected to narrow over the next three years as the economy and to measure per cent in the fiscal the overall government debt to gdp ratio is expected to peak at per cent in the medium this fiscal trajectory is consistent with fiscal sustainability and the mpc does not foresee a possible conflict with monetary policy objectives should this trend be moderate recovery in domestic economic growth appears to be both the composite

remains promising despite the risks posed by an uncertain global world growth is expected to remain buoyant in most although international oil price developments continue to weigh on global growth and inflation at the same world growth has underpinned international commodity prices along with positive investor have contributed to the recent strength in the this has been despite monetary policy tightening in a number of in particular the united states of america and the euro there are few signs of a slowdown in domestic output growth in the manufacturing and mining sectors have shown some signs of moderation in the final quarter of although overall growth is expected to remain relatively domestic demand conditions and oil price uncertainties pose the biggest risk to the inflation inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds declined to per cent in but increased to per cent in although domestic petrol prices were decreased by a total of in these two these prices nevertheless increased on a basis by per cent and per cent if petrol prices were excluded from this cpix inflation would

measured per cent and per cent in november and december compared to per cent in administered price inflation has also continued to falling to per cent and per cent in november and december if petrol prices were administered prices would have increased at a rate of per cent in each of the three months to december more or less in line with overall cpix and footwear continue to put downward pressure on and prices in these two categories declined at rates of around per cent in the last months of by food prices rose at an annual rate of per cent in compared to the average for the year of per the december increase in food prices was mainly attributable to meat prices which rose at a rate of per compared to per cent the previous price inflation has exhibited a more discernible rising with producer price inflation measuring per cent and per cent in november and december imported goods inflation measured per cent and per cent in these two months while domestically produced goods increased by per cent and per cent producer price inflation for as a whole averaged per cent compared to per cent the previous outlook for the last mpc the inflation forecast of the south african reserve bank has changed with the inflation trajectory now expected to follow a more moderately rising trend compared to that discussed at the previous according to the central cpix inflation is expected to peak at around per cent in the first quarter of whereafter it is expected to decline slowly to reach around per cent at the end of the forecast usual the mpc considered the factors that brought about this outlook as well as the related the robust domestic demand is an important factor which could negatively affect the inflation to there have not been any significant inflationary although this could change if demand growth were to accelerate are that household consumption expenditure growth has remained according to the latest consumer confidence reached a record high in the fourth quarter of new vehicle sales reached an high in and increased by per cent over the year as a retail sales have also continued to grow and recent trading and earnings updates from as well as credit extension suggest that sales growth in november and december of probably matched or exceeded the per cent growth recorded in strong domestic demand has been underpinned by the growth in credit total loans and advances to the private sector grew at rates of around per cent during october and november and rose to per cent in this growth in total loans and advances has been driven mainly by an increase in mortgage advances extended to the household sector remain particularly price developments and their related wealth effects have probably also contributed to the consumption the housing market remains although the rate of increase in house prices has moderated in december the absa house price index increased on a basis by per moreover the recent stellar performance of the jse securities exchange could also impact on consumer during the past few share prices have continued to reach new since reaching a low point for in the index has increased by approximately per brisk domestic demand has had an impact on the current account deficit which increased to per cent of gdp in the third quarter of sizeable trade surplus was recorded in december following a sharp decline in this has contributed to a significant narrowing of the trade deficit from billion in the third quarter to billion in the fourth quarter of this is likely to result in a narrowing of the current account deficit in that strong domestic demand is expected to maintain pressure on the current however the current account deficit continues to be more than adequately financed by capital inflows which in turn are being attracted by improved economic growth prospects in south the overall balance of payments has remained in and the level of official gross gold and foreign exchange reserves increased to billion at the end of january coincident business cycle indicator declined slightly in october although indications are that the economy is still growing at a healthy but perhaps more moderate the physical volume of mining production declined in october and while manufacturing output declined in mainly as a result of supply issues in the petroleum industry related to the change to although refinery continued into manufacturing output recovered somewhat in that recording a growth of per the latest investec purchasing managers index also indicates that there might be a general slackening in manufacturing sector the various business confidence indices indicate that confidence generally remains at high exogenous namely oil and food price are potential risks to the inflation at the time of the last mpc meeting the price of brent crude oil was around per but since the beginning of international oil prices have risen again to levels of around per apart from continued strong demand for upward pressure on prices has emanated from supply threats related to the higher prices have already resulted in a domestic petrol price increase of per litre in which more than offset the per litre decrease in in food price inflation are also a potential as noted food price inflation has accelerated but is still relatively food price inflation is expected to be higher in partly as a result of the low base in the higher food price inflation evident in production along with higher maize prices also point to a possible acceleration in retail food price inflation going are a number of factors which have contributed to the positive inflation these include continued fiscal low world inflation and inflation inflation expectations as indicated in the inflation measured as the yield differential between conventional bonds and point to some improvement in inflation expectations since the last wage growth recorded a increase of per cent in the third quarter of however positive productivity growth ensured that unit labour cost increases have remained consistent with the inflation unit labour cost in the formal sectors recorded annual increases of per cent and per cent in the second and third quarters of unit labour cost in manufacturing grew at an annual rate of per cent in the third these moderate trends in wage increases are consistent with the latest andrew levy

the fact that the inflation pressures do not excess demand conditions in the household consumption remains and credit extension to households is contracting in we do have to be mindful of effects of

demand pressures are still not assessed to pose a significant risk to the inflation approach of the mpc is to look through the effects and focus on the possible effects of supply side shocks of a

act now or given the relative stability in the underlying core inflation delaying the adjustment could give the mpc room to these unfolding developments in subsequent delaying the adjustment could

confluence of shocks that have the potential to stall the nascent these shocks include higher international oil driven in part by events in north africa and the middle and the recent disasters in japan which could have a negative impact on the global manufacturing supply the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area remains a with cds spreads signaling increased risks of sovereign debt the us outlook appears but the weak housing market and the ability of the economy to sustain growth once the fiscal stimuli dissipate during the year are some of the risks that in emerging markets remains but asian economies in particular may be negatively impacted by the recent developments in the global growth outlook may also be dependent on the extent to which the authorities in china manage to slow their economy global inflation outlook has also deteriorated somewhat in the face of higher oil and food although in some of the advanced economies there is a marked divergence between core and headline this reflects the relatively weak underlying demand and the generally accommodative monetary policies in these in the faster growing emerging inflation pressures are more and monetary policy

previous this positive if may contribute meaningfully to attaining an environment of low inflation and employment biggest risks to the inflation outlook remain food and administered in particular oil international oil prices had already accelerated in the latter part of in response to strong global demand and this upward trend has been reinforced by the events in north africa and the middle east which have raised concerns about the security of oil should these political issues be resolved the underlying demand pressures are likely to still keep oil prices at relatively elevated since the previous meeting of the brent crude oil prices have increased by almost per domestic petrol prices have increased by just under per litre since january and a further upward adjustment is expected in april in addition to the increased fuel mpc is of the view that the risks to the inflation outlook are on the these risks and underlying pressures are mainly of a cost push in light of the the mpc has decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at per cent per annum for the time given the significant upside risks to the inflation the mpc will closely monitor any indications of second round effects on inflation emanating from these cost the domestic economy has shown signs of moderate improvement since the previous meeting of the monetary policy inflation expectations have inflation has returned to within the target range and is expected to remain there for the remainder of the forecast the risks to the inflation outlook have declined somewhat as a result of the continued appreciation of the exchange rate of the rand and greater certainty with respect to future electricity tariff household consumption expenditure is growing at albeit low but growth in private sector

extension was again the only category that showed positive while loans to companies declined the subdued credit extension data are a function of both demand and supply side the strict credit criteria

negative the purchasing managers index indicates that this trend is likely to business as measured by the business confidence index also showed an improvement but remains sustainability of the recovery in domestic growth will be influenced to a significant degree by the global growth the pattern of the global economic recovery has remained unchanged with strong growth being recorded in asia in and more moderate growth in a number of countries in latin america and the outlook for the united states and europe is less positive with increased concerns about the sustainability of burgeoning fiscal deficits and government debt in the united the weak housing market also remains a constraint on household consumption although a number of countries have begun to normalise their policy monetary and fiscal stimuli still remain in place in most industrialised and indications are that there will not be an early reversal of these accommodative against this the benign global inflation environment is expected to and the risk of imported inflation is relatively an appreciated rand exchange rate is a positive factor in the inflation an excessively strong exchange rate is a cause for concern from the perspective of overall macroeconomic it is difficult to determine with precision an appropriate level of the exchange but at recent levels the exchange rate may contribute to constraints in the recovery of export and sectors of the the previous meeting of the the rand has appreciated from levels of around against the us dollar to current levels of around on a the rand has appreciated by about per cent since the previous meeting and by per cent since the beginning of the the exchange rate was also influenced by the recent weakness in the euro and pound sterling against the us since the previous the rand has appreciated by about per cent and per cent against the euro and pound sterling number of factors continue to impact on the exchange rate of the these include the sustained capital inflows into emerging markets in general in response to abnormally low interest rates in advanced investor and the recovery in commodity the latter contributed to the narrowing of the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments in the final quarter of to per cent of supply side or exogenous factors are not expected to impart a significant upside risk to the inflation international oil prices have remained relatively stable in the dollar and moderate increases over the forecast period have been incorporated into the inflation nevertheless an increase in the order of cents per litre has been assumed for about half of which is due to increased fuel levies announced in the food which for most of last year were one of the main sources of upside risk to the inflation have recently contributed favourably to the inflation in the past few maize prices have declined despite an upward trend in other food prices while it is not clear at this stage to what extent these price declines will be passed on to the these developments should at least constrain food price increases for some settlements continue to indicate some moderation but remain positive in real the ratio of total compensation of employees to real gdp declined from per cent in the year to the third quarter of to per cent in the year to the fourth nominal unit labour costs increased from per cent in the third quarter to per cent in the fourth quarter of but this figure was distorted by significant adjustments to some public sector pay the reduced uncertainty associated with the electricity tariff electricity and other administered price increases remain a threat to the inflation of concern is the apparent trend towards greater reliance on high tariff increases to finance long term infrastructural expenditure these increases are in effect relative price changes or implicit tax however they contribute to the general inflation environment and remain a challenge for monetary monetary policy assessment of the monetary policy committee is that despite clear signs that the economy has emerged from the the pace of recovery is expected to remain the improved inflation environment has provided some space for an additional monetary stimulus to reinforce the sustainability of the upswing without jeopardising the achievement of the inflation the mpc has therefore

november page committee meetings dates for january march may july september november media mtshali the meeting of the monetary policy committee in december the outlook for inflation has on balance inflation with respect to both consumer and producer have been below mainly as a result of moderating food price inflation and lower international oil some risks to the outlook there are still only tentative signs that consumer demand growth is credit extension has continued to grow at a robust the challenge for monetary policy is to weigh up the perceived medium to risks against the more favourable in the past few the mpc has consistently seen these risks to be firmly on the developments in inflation as measured by the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost on mortgage bonds has remained constant at per cent for the three months to december of in as a cpix inflation averaged per cent compared to per cent in in goods price inflation was unchanged from november at per while services price inflation increased to per cent from per cent in november driven mainly by higher rates of increase in housing services and medical

main contributor to food price increased by per cent in december compared to rates of increase of just below per cent in the previous two the petrol price increased at a rate of per cent in despite the price decrease in that prices of clothing and footwear fell by almost per cent in december compared to the previous price inflation also shows signs that it may have having measured per cent in both october and november production price inflation declined to per cent in imported goods inflation measured per cent compared to domestically produced goods inflation of per the contribution of food to production price inflation moderated in december which suggests that pressure on food prices at the consumer level could be further outlook for most recent central forecast of the forecasting model indicates an improvement in the inflation outlook compared to the forecast considered at the december meeting of the monetary policy cpix inflation is no longer expected to breach the upper end of the but is now expected to peak at an average rate of around per cent in the second quarter of this year and to average per cent by the fourth quarter of in terms of the the improved outlook is primarily the result of the change in the monetary policy stance last year and the improved outlook with regard to expected international oil price are a number of additional developments contributing to this positive there is some evidence of an improvement in market expectations of inflation since the last mpc the yield curve has inverted reflecting in part an improvement in inflation the inflation rates as suggested by the yield differential between bonds and conventional government bonds indicate that inflation expectations have improved significantly since september when yields at shorter maturities exceeded per since inflation rates across all maturities have expectations are also reflected to some extent in wage settlements in the recent nominal wage developments are indicative of inflation expectations remaining under control despite a slight upward in the third quarter of unit labour costs increased at a rate of per compared to a second quarter increase of per according to andrew levy employment nominal wage settlements averaged per cent in compared to per cent in although wage settlements were slightly higher in the inflation rate was higher than in the previous if allowance is made for a moderate increase in labour these increases are consistent with the inflation domestic economy shows signs that the growth momentum has been maintained at rates around capacity utilisation levels remain particularly in construction and electricity although they are below the peak reached in the second quarter of growth in the mining and manufacturing sectors continued to display upward trends in seasonally adjusted total mining production increased by per cent in the three months ending december compared with the previous three while manufacturing sector output increased by per cent over the same the positive trend in manufacturing is expected to be sustained as reflected in the purchasing managers index which reached a level of in january exchange rate of the rand has been relatively stable and averaged to the us dollar since the last mpc meeting when it was trading at around during this it fluctuated in a range of between and to the us the rand is currently trading at around on a the rand is relatively unchanged since the last much of the volatility observed since the previous meeting has been due to movements of the us dollar against other fluctuations in commodity prices and generally illiquid conditions in the local foreign exchange market at the end of the of payments developments suggest that the deficit on the current account might have widened significantly in the fourth quarter of following an increase in the trade preliminary estimates indicate that the deficit on the trade account of the balance of payments more than doubled from the third to the fourth quarter of in the fourth the value of merchandise imports increased by about per cent from the third while the value of merchandise exports increased by about per much of the import momentum in the fourth can be ascribed to the per cent increase in the volume of oil imports compared to the third this inventory appears to be exceptional and oil imports are unlikely to be sustained at these have emphasised on a number of occasions that the mpc does not have a target for the current nor does the mpc view deficits on the current account to be inflationary in the mandate of the bank is to maintain inflation within the target range of to per the risk to inflation arises if the market perceives a particular level of the current account to be which could have implications for the exchange rate and consequently for the inflation to date the current account including that in the fourth has been adequately current developments appear to indicate that the current account deficit will continue to be adequately financed given the coherent macroeconomic policy framework of the country and positive growth purchases of south african bonds and equities totaled billion in as a compared to billion for this year to the have been net buyers of bonds and equities to the value of around official gross gold and other foreign exchange reserves stood at billion at the end of december and the international liquidity position amounted to policy has remained supportive of monetary international factors also provide a benign backdrop to the inflation global growth prospects generally remain with most regions expected to experience sustainable growth the global interest rate cycle appears to have peaked in most and world inflation is expected to remain under oil price developments have impacted positively on inflation the price of north sea brent crude which was above per barrel at the time of the december reached a low of around per barrel in january following the unseasonably warm winter in the northern however a further reduction in output quotas by effective from february and colder weather in europe and the us resulted in prices rising back towards per in the past few days the price of brent crude has declined to around per barrel as fears of further opec cuts domestic petrol prices increased by per litre in but were reduced by cents per litre in this recent relative stability in the oil market has reduced the risk posed to inflation from this given the tight supply and demand conditions in the oil prices remain vulnerable to geopolitical has been the case in the past few the central concern of the mpc was the continued strong pace of household consumption expenditure growth and its potential impact on it is recognised that there are lags in the adjustment to interest rate and the question facing the committee was the extent to which further reactions to interest rate changes can still be this is a difficult judgement call to make in the light of the inevitable lags in data consumer still appears to be growing robustly despite the basis point increase in the repo rate last real retail sales growth increased at a rate of per cent in november but moderated somewhat to per cent in on a seasonally adjusted basis a decline of per cent was it is still premature to tell whether this is the beginning of a new there are also tentative signs that demand for motor vehicles may be consumption expenditure has been underpinned by the continued asset price growth which has contributed to the sustained strength in household balance share prices on the jse securities exchange have continued to reach new the index increased by per cent during and since the last meeting of the mpc has increased by per house prices have also continued to increase at a brisk according to the absa house price house prices are still growing at rates of almost per growth in loans and advances extended to the private sector increased by almost per cent in although the annualised quarterly growth showed some sign of declining from per cent in the third quarter to per cent in the fourth mortgage advances grew at rates of around per cent for much of while instalment sale credit and leasing finance recorded growth of per cent in these increases were despite further securitisation transactions on the part of the of significance is the fact that growth in total loans and advances to the corporate sector increased from per cent in october to per cent in whereas growth of credit extended to the household sector declined from per cent in october to per cent in policy the basis of the foregoing the monetary policy committee is satisfied that the inflation outlook has improved somewhat and expects inflation to remain within the target range for the forecast as the mandate of the bank is to keep inflation within the inflation target the monetary policy committee has decided to leave the repo rate unchanged for now at per cent per risks to the inflation outlook remain and the mpc will continue to closely monitor developments with a view to adjusting the monetary policy stance as and when since the previous meeting of the monetary policy committee the global has been dominated by heightened uncertainty relating to the debt in greece and the sharp decline in equity prices in while

world economic outlook remains preliminary estimates made by the international monetary fund indicate that world economic growth reached nearly per cent in the highest figure in almost three this growth was with particularly high increases in china and other asian the united states of america and a number of emerging market economic growth in the euro area was more moderate at about per but was nevertheless considerably higher than the per cent recorded in although the imf forecast indicates some moderation in global economic growth during it is generally projected to amount to the still high figure of per cent for the year as a buoyant world economic conditions together with strong domestic demand led to an acceleration in the rate of increase in the real gross domestic product of south africa from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of per cent in the fourth quarter of to per cent in the third quarter of national accounts statistics are not yet available for the fourth quarter of but production statistics for some sectors seem to indicate that growth was however there are indications of a slowdown in manufacturing sector output employment in the formal sectors of the economy increased in after a prolonged period of while domestic inflation remained within the inflation target of to per inflation the last meeting of the monetary policy committee the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds has fluctuated around the of the target owing largely to increases in petrol and diesel the growth rate of cpix at first rose from per cent in october to per cent in the subsequent decline in the running costs of motor vehicles and lower food prices brought the increase in cpix down to per cent in the rate of increase in the cpix excluding diesel and food prices rose slightly from per cent in october to per cent in from quarter to quarter at seasonally adjusted and annualised cpix inflation accelerated from per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the fourth this acceleration in the pace of inflation was mainly due to more rapid increases in the prices of goods and occurred in most of the main goods categories with the exception of new and used the year as a whole cpix inflation averaged per compared with per cent in the lower inflation to a large brought about by continued monetary and fiscal discipline applied by the an appreciation in the external value of the rand and moderate increases in food these factors had a major impact on the prices of with the result that the rate of increase in the prices of goods averaged only per cent in in the inflation in service prices included in the cpix remained stubbornly high at an average of per in medical costs and education fees increased at rates well above the upper limit of the inflation the second year in a row production price inflation in south africa remained the average rate of increase in the domestic price index amounted to per cent in and per cent in this was largely due to the continued strength of the rand in the foreign exchange the effect of the appreciation in the exchange rate of the rand is clearly illustrated by the further decline of per cent in the prices of imported goods in this decline in the cost of imported goods enabled domestic producers to contain price the average rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods slowed down from per cent in to per cent in rate of decline in the prices of imported goods moderated markedly in the fourth quarter of but the rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods slowed the rate of increase in the production price index declined from a seasonally adjusted and annualised level of per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the fourth inflation the last quarter of the rand appreciated further as the united states dollar weakened against the euro and other during to date the nominal effective exchange rate of the rand has eased back slightly as the dollar has steadied but nevertheless remains still stronger than the average for as a the recent easing in the average value of the rand was accompanied by an increase in the brent price of oil from about to over the same the outlook for inflation improved because the petrol price per litre was lowered further by cents in january and cents in the longer term there are a number of developments which could also lead to a favourable inflation as indicated in the last mpc the recent improvement in inflationary expectations is of particular significance in this regard owing to the prominent role that these expectations play in the monetary policy transmission inflation expectations which fall within the inflation target signal that cpix inflation could be maintained within the target range of to per cent in the forecast important recent development which bodes well for inflation is the marked moderation in salary and wage the rate of increase in nominal remuneration per worker in the formal sectors of the economy moderated from per cent in to per cent in and per cent in the year to the third quarter of labour productivity growth which averaged per cent in came down to figures of per cent in the second quarter of and per cent in the third as a the rate of increase in nominal unit labour cost rose from per cent in to per cent over the year up to the third quarter of factors that could contribute to the maintenance of low inflation in the next two years include the commitment by the government to fiscal prudence and of the public authorities to low administered price moderation in the increases in food prices and continued low inflation the international monetary fund expects global inflation to remain at about per cent in major risks to the achievement of the inflation target have not changed to any significant extent since the last meeting of the monetary policy these sustained strong growth in domestic demand as a result of lower interest tax still relatively high personal disposable income positive wealth effects arising from increases in the prices of real and bonds and the need for expenditure on infrastructural development and the extension of the production capacity of the the continued strength in demand led to an acceleration in the growth rate of the economy to a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of per cent in the third quarter of although some indicators point to a slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the fourth capacity constraints could eventually put pressure on domestic increase in domestic demand also brought about an increase in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments due to a sharp rise in the demand for imported goods and the rise in imports was partly neutralised by higher exports arising from strong international economic growth and increases in international commodity the deficit on the current account was easily financed by a substantial inflow of portfolio and capital from the rest of the which made it possible to increase the official foreign continued increases in money supply in the growth over twelve months in the broadly defined money supply amounted to per cent in december which was lower than at the end of the preceding quarter but slightly higher than the per cent in december seasonally adjusted and annualised growth in rose from per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the fourth during the course of there was a reallocation of funds from longer term deposits to increase s in these deposits usually reflect a rise in the transaction demand for strong demand for bank credit in the growth rate in the total loans and advances of banks rose from per cent in december to per cent in december the quarterly growth in total loans and advances increased from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the fourth credit was largely responsible for this the demand for these kind of loans measured over a period of twelve months increased from per cent in december to per cent in december in the growth rate of outstanding balances on credit cards and general advances slowed down over the same but these loans picked up somewhat in the fourth quarter of likely impact of external in the manner and speed of the processes of adjustment to existing global how far these adjustments will run in the months ahead remains the monetary policy stance in south africa will continue to focus on maintaining inflation within the inflation target and will weigh amongst others the impact of these adjustments on the the impact of such movements on the medium term outlook for and the need for south africa to have a competitive and stable exchange recent favourable developments have improved our inflation forecasts and have led to a downward revision of inflationary pressures over the forecast period up to the end of according to our central cpix inflation could rise moderately during to a little above the midpoint of the range and then ease somewhat during the rest of the forecast policy monetary policy committee deliberated extensively on the appropriate policy stance at this particular point in given the presence of so many uncertainties and given the balance of the mpc decided to maintain the current stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at per cent per the mpc will continue to monitor developments in the economy and the factors affecting inflation very closely and will stand ready to adjust the stance in either direction if necessary depending on the outlook for since the previous meeting of the monetary policy committee the intensity of the financial crisis in the eurozone appears to have subsided but the very mixed signals indicate that the crisis is not necessarily despite the positive the global outlook remains fragile amid doubts about the strength of the us a recession in the extent of a slowdown in china and higher international oil economic growth remains but the improved performance of the economy in the fourth quarter of and some positive developments in the global economy indicate a slightly better outlook than previously the most recent inflation outcome surprised on the and there has been a slight downward revision to the inflation forecast while inflation expectations continue to be anchored around the upper end of the inflation target inflation appears to be somewhat more but in line with our previous and the risks to the outlook remain evenly inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index for all urban areas was per cent in down from per cent in this favourable outcome was primarily the result of a moderation in food price from per cent to per the categories of housing and and transport together accounted for percentage points of the inflation cpi inflation excluding petrol and electricity increased from per cent

declined from per cent in january to per cent in while manufactured food price inflation remained unchanged at per inflation forecast of the bank is marginally lower than at the time of the previous meeting of the inflation is still expected to peak in the second quarter of but at a slightly lower rate of per cent and to average per cent in the final quarter of and per cent in the subsequent inflation is expected to measure per cent by the end of the forecast period at the end of the slightly improved inflation trajectory is mainly a result of a less depreciated exchange rate following the change in the electricity tariffs by the electricity price assumption has been reduced from per cent to per given the low weight of electricity in the cpi the impact on the forecast was forecast for core as measured by headline inflation excluding electricity and continues to show an upward reflecting possibly more inflation pressures as well as base this measure is expected to peak at an

financial analysts are marginally higher than those reflected in the latest reuters survey of market analysts which shows expected inflation to average per cent in and per cent in the following two immediate threat to the global economy posed by the european sovereign debt crisis appears to have subsided but significant risks market signals in respect of what progress is being made with the resolution of the crisis are but spreads on sovereign debt of the affected european economies have narrowed partly as a result of the greek debt as well as liquidity provision by the ecb which has been directed in part to increased purchases of sovereign debt by despite these positive the eurozone economy is still expected to experience a recession this year in the face of widespread fiscal austerity and tight bank lending continued deleveraging by banks is a considerable risk given potential us economy shows signs of improvement but the economy still has a negative output and there are some doubts about the sustainability of this growth the chinese economy has shown signs of but a hard landing is not generally emerging market growth generally is also more and the policy tightening that had been a feature of many of these economies earlier in has either stopped or been inflation appears to be broadly contained amid slowing growth and declining food price however international oil price driven mainly by geopolitical are posing an increasing risk not only to but also to the growth the previous meeting of the the rand has appreciated in line with declining risk aversion in global financial the volatility of the rand has also with the rand fluctuating in a range of between and to the us dollar since the beginning of since the beginning of the the rand has appreciated by

slightly more favourable against the backdrop of a more positive global in an annual real growth rate of per cent was following a fourth quarter growth rate of per the latter was driven mainly by positive contributions from the manufacturing and mining partly reflecting some normalisation following the impact on the third quarter growth performance of industrial action and other the gdp growth

increased from per cent to per this moderately improved outlook is consistent with the increase in the business confidence index in the first quarter of to above the neutral level of as well as the positive trend observed in the south african reserve composite leading nevertheless the expected growth rates remains disappointing and still imply a persistence of the negative output the improved the outlook for the mining sector continues to disappoint with an annualised growth rate of per cent in the final quarter of last in january mining output contracted at a rate of per and output in february is expected to have been negatively impacted by industrial maintenance and electricity supply the recovery in the manufacturing sector is expected to the physical volume of manufacturing output increased by per cent on a basis in while the purchasing managers index increased significantly from index points in january to index points in its highest level since february nevertheless the

quarter of and per cent for the nevertheless the ratio of gross fixed capital formation to gdp at per is still significantly below the peak of per cent reached in the final quarter of the renewed focus by government on infrastructure expenditure and successful implementation should underpin fixed capital and also give a boost to the domestic construction sector which remains under there are that continued underspending on infrastructure by provincial and local as well as possible electricity supply could retard these sector employment growth was relatively low in the fourth quarter of according to the quarterly employment statistics of statistics south formal sector employment grew at a rate of per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis the growth was in fact slightly and by per cent

consistent with a further increase in disposable income of positive wealth effects and a low interest rate these growth consumption is not expected to pose a significant risk to and there are some indications that consumption expenditure growth may have peaked following the per cent contraction in retail sales growth in january and a moderation in new vehicle sales growth in the consumer

remained subdued at per cent in with the main driver coming from the category of loans and all the components of this category showed strong growth in credit card advances increased by per cent year bank overdrafts by per having experienced negative growth between january and march and general loans which moderated slightly to per cent in january from per cent in latter category is mainly made up of unsecured where loans to households continue to grow at rates of around per while this is still a relatively small proportion of total loans and it appears to be an increasingly important source of funding of consumer at this stage it is not translating into excessive consumption but this trend towards unsecured lending is being carefully examined to ensure we have a better understanding of what constitutes this the resulting higher household the ratio of household debt to disposable income declined further to per cent in the final quarter of compared with the peak of per cent in the first quarter of the household debt service costs to disposable income are at levels well below their long term recent national government budget tabled before parliament indicates a moderately tighter

increased by around per barrel since the previous mainly as a result of increased geopolitical while an escalation of these risks could cause further upward oil price increases are likely to be constrained by the fact that higher oil prices could derail the global recovery and therefore reduce domestic petrol prices have been impacted by these global in the past two petrol prices have increased by cents per but would have been significantly higher were it not for the more appreciated exchange a further sizeable increase is expected in which will include a cent per litre increase in the fuel prices remain an important determinant of and as noted were the main contributors to the downward movement of cpi inflation in some further partly a result of base may be expected over the coming global food price indices had been declining consistently in but there has been some reversal of this trend in january and nevertheless global food prices remain well below the levels reached in the first few months of impact of these developments on domestic prices will also depend on the rand exchange rate and local there has been some moderation in domestic grain price following sharp increases in maize prices in the second half of we therefore could see a further moderation in food price inflation in the coming but the longer term outlook is mpc is of the view that while the main pressures on inflation are of a cost push there is some evidence that these pressures may be becoming more however these developments are in line with our previous forecasts and are expected to remain contained by the relatively subdued state of the domestic although at this stage the committee assesses the risks to the inflation outlook to be fairly evenly greater vigilance will be required going main upside risk to inflation is seen to emanate from global oil and while food price inflation is expected to moderate in the short the longer term risks the exchange rate as highly but the risk posed to inflation in recent months has subsided somewhat given the less albeit global economic growth is expected to remain below in light of this and the expected inflation the committee is of the view that at this stage the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support the real economy while at the same time maintaining its commitment to achieve the inflation target over the medium the monetary policy committee has therefore decided to keep the repurchase rate unchanged at per cent per there are a number of key developments that this meeting of the monetary committee had to not least among them on the domestic the challenge of moderate rising a depreciated a current account deficit as well as difficult labour relations and that remains stubbornly the previous meeting of the mpc the domestic inflation outlook has risks posed by the depreciation of the rand exchange rate overshadowed the more favourable including lower price increases and some moderation in food

rising per cent in this growth outlook is corroborated by the persistent trend in the leading indicator of economic business remains low with the business confidence indicator falling to lowest level

trend in manufacturing is consistent with the barclays pmi has been above the neutral level since the ber manufacturing index also but still remains at low the real value of plans passed is indicative of some improvement in the particularly respect to residential this is not reflected in the building confidence index which declined further in the second the negative performance of the economy during the first quarter was the contraction in growth in gross fixed capital formation for the second by both the private sector and general these have contributed to the persistence of high rates of unemployment in the although formal employment increased in the first quarter this was largely due to temporary employment opportunities created by the electoral by private sector employment during

growth has relatively but there are risks of increases in excess of inflation and are as yet no clear signs of a recovery in the agricultural and food price is expected to remain elevated for some the bank expects food price to peak at per cent during the final quarter of this there are some signs of moderation in some food categories at both the producer and price and futures prices of grains have declined should prices stabilise or decline in the coming there is the potential for downside base effects next exchange rate developments will also critical in this as will global food which have reversed their recent supply disruptions and curtailments by a number of the price of crude oil has mostly traded within a band of and since the meeting of the the model assumes a very moderate upward in oil prices over the forecast but there may be a degree of downside in the short with some upside risk in the outer period as global demand the domestic petrol price increased by a cumulative cents per litre in past two due to both the exchange rate and international the recent appreciation of the rand coupled with a lower average oil price resulted in a substantial in the petrol and a sizeable in retail prices is expected in monetary policy committee remains concerned about the weak economic outlook and the medium term inflation trajectory which remains outside the range of to per cent until the second half of next nevertheless there been some improvements in the near term inflation prospects following downside this is also the case for core where the breach of the upper end of the target range is now less while risks to the inflation forecast are assessed to remain on the these risks moderated uncertainties appear to have delayed monetary policy tightening in advanced the impact of the more appreciated rand exchange rate on the inflation will depend to a large extent on whether the exchange rate is sustained at stronger current exchange rate levels are stronger than those implicit in providing some buffer to the the rand remains sensitive to domestic and external and the recent trends can be quickly outlook is clouded by the uncertainty surrounding the longer term market and growth implications of the implications for the rand and domestic and ultimately could vary quite significantly depending on which plays weaker global growth scenario could also imply that there may be a degree of risk to the international oil price which was adjusted combination of a stronger exchange rate and subdued international oil prices have a favourable impact on domestic petrol prices in the coming the committee assesses the longer term risk to this assumption to be on as global growth and oil demand are expected to prices remain an upside risk in the near there could however be a sharp in agricultural prices next year should favourable weather patterns transpire the absence of demand pressures and weak consumption expenditure may also contribute to downside the committee remains concerned about the overall inflation the of the balance of risks to the inflation outlook and the weak domestic has provided some room to delay further tightening of the monetary policy for accordingly the mpc has unanimously decided to keep the rate unchanged at per cent per mpc is aware that some of the favourable factors that contributed to this could reverse and remains ready to react appropriately to any change in the inflation the last meeting of the monetary policy committee the rate of cpix inflation has remained below the of the inflation target the success achieved in bringing inflation down to levels last experienced in the has been a major accomplishment of the macroeconomic policies pursued by the prudent monetary disciplined fiscal the significant recovery in the external value of the rand and the moderation in food price indications are on the basis of this improved inflation the in growth that is already evident is likely to improve during and inflation rate of increase in the consumer price index for metropolitan and other urban areas excluding the interest cost of mortgage bonds decreased from per cent in october and november to per cent in august and moved below the per cent upper limit of the inflation target range to a value of per cent in cpix inflation then slowed down further to a rate of per cent in december before increasing marginally to per cent in january for the year as a whole cpix inflation averaged per compared with per cent in from quarter to the slowdown in cpix inflation was even more this rate of increase in the cpix decreased from a seasonally adjusted and annualised level of per cent in the second quarter of to per cent in the fourth quarter of number of factors contributed to the deceleration in the inflation rate in south particularly important in this context was the percentage points increase in the repo rate during this restrictive monetary policy stance and the discipline applied in government finances led to a decline in inflation the recovery in the exchange rate of the rand from the beginning of assisted in this process and eventually led to a decline in the prices of imported in addition to these more fundamental slower rates of increase in food and energy prices also contributed to the lowering of in if energy and food prices are excluded from the the rate of increase in the prices of other goods and services declined from a peak of per cent in november to per cent in january for services excluding the cost of mortgage bonds remained after fluctuating around a level of per cent in the first nine months of the rate of increase in these prices moderated somewhat from a peak of per cent in september to per cent in january by the rate of increase over twelve months in the prices of consumer goods fell from per cent in october to per cent in january slowdown in the rate of increase in the prices of domestically produced goods and the decline in the prices of imported goods caused the rate of increase in the production price index to decrease from per cent in september to per cent in august the production price index declined throughout the last five months of the for the year as a overall production prices rose by per cent compared to per cent in the rate of decrease in the production price index moderated per cent in december to per cent in january inflation only did the inflation outcome improve since the last meeting of the monetary policy but the inflation outlook generally also remained most analysts and economic commentators expect cpix inflation to remain within the inflation target range over the next two inflation is projected to accelerate moderately during the course of to levels close to the upper limit of the inflation followed by somewhat slower rates of increase during these expected developments are consistent with projections made by the reserve core econometric and other number of factors will probably help to keep inflation within the target range during the next two the generally low inflation in the rest of the world will continue to assist south africa in containing domestic strong global economic growth driven by the united states and asia is expected to occur in an environment of relatively stable prices which bodes well for domestic price the slowdown in aggregate domestic production in has led to a decline in the utilisation of production capacity of manufacturing enterprises from a seasonally adjusted rate of per cent in the third quarter of to per cent in the fourth quarter of although the world economic recovery has set in motion an upswing in international commodity some of these benefits to economic growth in south africa have been neutralised by the exchange rate real gross domestic fixed investment again increased significantly in as a the acceleration in domestic economic growth is unlikely to lead to capacity constraints in the near the fiscal discipline applied by government has materially contributed to the lowering of inflation and the budget for fiscal year is supportive of the inflation oil prices are not expected to be a threat to domestic price increases in the next two years despite the recent increases in the retail prices of petrol and the world oil demand and supply seem to be more or less in balance and opec continues to manage production limits to avoid large disruptive price most analysts still expect oil prices to decline somewhat in the coming but by no means the recommended tariff increases of some public utility companies also auger well for the inflation the inflation outlook is generally certain recent developments signal a moderate increase in cpix inflation during which will have to be carefully monitored by the monetary policy of particular concern is the consistent tendency of the wage settlement process to ignore the inflation the effect of these tendencies will continue to put pressure on price increases in an anticipated moderation in wage settlement rates during the course of the year in line with the inflation target and a rise in productivity lead to lower rates of increase in nominal unit labour development which could cause higher increases in consumer prices is the severe drought in some parts of south low rainfall in important agricultural regions is expected to reduce the maize and other grain crops in this could be neutralised to a large extent by the run down of inventories or the increase in but the future price of maize has already increased substantially from the beginning of december an anticipated rise in international food prices could also lead to an acceleration in the prices of domestic food even if these effects on food prices are it seems unlikely that the positive impact that food prices had on the lowering of the inflation rate during will again occur in even more important for the future inflation outlook is the continued acceleration in the growth of domestic final demand for goods and national accounts statistics are not yet available for the fourth quarter of many such as retail trade at constant the purchases of new and used vehicles and electricity signal that domestic demand continued to increase at a high rate during the last half of the full effect of the substantial reduction in interest rates from june will only become apparent during the course of the growth in domestic demand exceeded the rate of increase in the surplus on the current account of the balance of payments in changed to a deficit in the first quarter of trade statistics for the fourth quarter of the year indicate that this deficit could have widened further to a preliminary estimated per cent of gross domestic although this is a sizeable it was easily financed by the surplus on the financial this financial inflow also paved the way for a build up of net foreign further deficit on the current account of the balance of payments is projected for but this deficit is not expected to exceed per cent of gross domestic it seems unlikely that the positive effect that the significant recovery in the exchange rate of the rand had on inflation during will be as pronounced this high domestic demand has been financed to some extent by means of bank credit extension and the issuing of bonds by government and the private the total net issues of securities listed on the bond exchange of south africa of both the public and private sector amounted to billion in compared with net redemptions of billion in the growth in underlying bank credit extension to the private sector private sector credit extension excluding investments and bills rose from per cent in december to around per cent since april and amounted to per cent in growth in such advances slowed down from a seasonally adjusted and annualised rate of per cent in the second quarter of to per cent in the fourth in money supply remained relatively growth over twelve months in the broadly defined money supply slowed down to a low of per cent in august before picking up to per cent in the seasonally adjusted and annualised growth in declined from per cent in the second quarter of to per cent in the third quarter and rose to per cent in the fourth this moderate growth in money supply reflected the low growth in domestic economic the low inflation environment and lower interest rates on deposits of all to some extent it was also due to the substitution of investments in promissory notes of banks not included in money supply for investments in negotiable certificates of deposits which form part of money supply due to a change in the regulations regarding stamp duties payable on these policy these factors into the central expectation of the monetary policy committee is that cpix inflation will remain within the target range during the forecast period while the economy continues to pick up accordingly the monetary policy committee has decided to maintain the current monetary policy stance and keep the repo rate unchanged at per cent per the monetary policy committee will continue to monitor all the risk factors to the inflation if the outlook the committee will not hesitate to change the monetary policy since the previous meeting of the monetary policy committee there have been further indications of a generalised slowdown in the global amid the continuing risks posed by the banking and sovereign debt crises in the this negative outlook has contributed to renewed monetary policy easing in a number of including in emerging market in an environment of declining commodity prices and subdued global inflation has continued its downward and is expected to remain within the target range over the forecast despite some moderate employment

higher outcome is with inflation expected to have peaked at an average of per cent in the first quarter of it is now expected to continue to moderate over the next few reaching a low of per cent in the second quarter of inflation is then expected to remain fairly stable around the per cent level to the end of inflation is expected to average per cent in and per cent in both and the improved

since the previous meeting of the with mounting evidence of a global negative indicators include a fall in the global manufacturing pmi to its lowest level in three the lack of meaningful progress towards a resolution of the eurozone crisis continues to be a source of global instability and despite initiatives to stabilise the banking the growth outlook for the region remains as fiscal austerity measures and bank deleveraging continue to impact adversely on growth and on unemployment rates that have reached new in the first quarter of most of the eurozone members recorded negative or marginally positive particularly those in the the uk economy is currently also experiencing a us economy slowed in the second quarter and the outlook has concerns relating to the fiscal cliff

exchange rate volatility has increased and the rand has fluctuated in a range of between and against the us partly in response to fluctuations in the euro against the us the rand appreciated since the previous meeting by around per cent against the us by per cent against the euro and by per cent on a this period the rand was also impacted by strong inflows into the domestic bond following the confirmation that south africa will be included in the citibank world government bond index from late since the beginning of the have been net purchasers of south african government bonds to the value of in june alone net purchases of bonds by amounted to the second highest monthly inflow ever into the bond much of this is estimated to have been real money which possibly contributed to the generally appreciating exchange rate trend in that month and declining yields in the domestic government bond these inflows are expected to persist for some time after the actual inclusion in the and will not only help fund the fiscal deficit but also the widening current account deficit on the balance of rand is expected to remain vulnerable to erratic shifts in global risk while a deterioration of global risk sentiment could cause further rand this could be offset to some extent by continued inflows into the bond market or the possible resumption of quantitative easing in the united domestic

declined by a total of per litre in the last two although a slight increase may be recorded next mpc is concerned about the increased downside risks posed to the domestic economy from global the problems in the eurozone are likely to persist for a protracted period and since the previous meeting the negative growth outlook has spread beyond in particular to the india and other emerging market the negative effects to south africa are likely to this unfavourable outlook is reinforced further by the fragile domestic private sector investment and consumption trends which are confirmed by declining business and consumer the mpc therefore sees the risks to the growth forecast to be on the mpc also considered the inflation environment to have improved notwithstanding possible pressures coming from food and energy prices in the medium upside pressure on inflation could be offset to some extent by lower global commodity while demand pressures are expected to remain although the exchange rate is likely to remain vulnerable to global risk the rand has shown some resilience in recent the mpc expects inflation to remain within the target range over the forecast period and sees the risks to the inflation forecast to be relatively the light of these developments the mpc views the prevailing conditions to be appropriate for further monetary accommodation to the economy that will not undermine the inflation the mpc has therefore decided to reduce the repurchase rate by basis points to per cent from friday july while it is recognised that such a move on its own will not overcome the challenges facing the it is felt that it can help alleviate some of the pressures faced by some a sustained increase in the potential output of the economy will require a concerted and coordinated effort from both government and the private the mpc will continue to monitor both domestic and global developments and will act appropriately in line with its
