update of economic outlook and baseline indicators of economic activity point to the recovery of the brazilian at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook remains with reduction of risk appetite towards emerging the main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around expectations for around and those regarding retreated to around inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for and for this scenario among other a path for the policy interest rate that ends at and at and a path for the exchange rate that ends at and at in this projections for administered price inflation are in and in in the scenario with a constant interest rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for and for in this the inflation projections for administered prices are for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the august copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies the committee judges that the latter risks have discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available indicators and information available after the temporary halt in the transportation sector that occurred at the end of may point to the continuation of economy recovery of the brazilian the baseline scenario entertains the continuation of recovery of economic at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this regarding the global the committee judges that the scenario remains challenging for emerging the baseline scenario assumes gradual normalization of monetary policy in central the committee members also mentioned the risks to the continued expansion of international with possible impacts on global in this the copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of payments and the environment of anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic the copom pondered the risks stemming from a possible additional deterioration in the outlook for emerging in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom bank of copom the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory in the all members agreed that july and august inflation along with projections for subsequent months corroborated the understanding that the effects of the halt in the transportation sector that occurred in the end of may were the committee members pointed out that several measures of underlying inflation have increased from levels considered reaching appropriate levels generally consistent with the inflation it is possible that recent relative price changes in a context of anchored inflation expectations have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation without posing risks to the maintenance of these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken the committee members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms along with the anchoring of inflation expectations should be monitored in order to evaluate possible more enduring effects from shocks on inflation their the committee reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation in face of occasional shocks that lead to changes in relative monetary policy should only focus on their the copom also highlighted that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be monetary policy will follow the same whether in face of inflationary shocks in the case of a shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange or in face of disinflationary shocks in the case of a favorable food price the committee emphasizes that this prescription requires an environment with anchored established how monetary policy should react to shocks that induce changes in relative the copom members discussed the extent of the exchange rate in the brazilian they assessed with the exception of some administered the level of has been the members that the intensity of depends on several such as the level of slack in the economy and the degree of anchoring of inflation the committee will monitor the different measures of to both inflation and underlying copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at adequate inflation projections close to the target for and high level of slack in the economy still prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural interest although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of members expressed the view that the current real interest rates provide stimulus to the committee also debated the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary all members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic conditions in on inflation the level of economic the balance of and inflation the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the committee assessed that this stimulus should be removed gradually if the prospective scenario for inflation at the relevant horizon its balance of risks copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over the committee members then discussed the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its august meeting and the appropriate monetary policy decision in light of such the committee judged that the outlook evolved in line with the baseline regarding the balance of on the one the committee judged that downward risks for the prospective inflation path due to propagation of low levels of inflation in the recent past have the persistence of a high level of economic slack poses downward risks to on the other it discussed the importance of the continuation of the process of adjustments and reforms in the brazilian economy and the risks associated with the deterioration of the scenario for emerging based on both sides of the balance of the copom members concluded that this balance is as the latter risks have based on all the copom members agreed to maintain the selic rate at copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary all members considered that the level of uncertainty of the current environment generates a need for greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary which recommends refraining from providing indications on the next steps of monetary the members of the copom considered that it is important to reinforce their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to maintain the path for prospective inflation in line with the this requires flexibility to gradually adjust the conduct of monetary bank of copom and if this ability to respond to different circumstances contributes to the maintenance of the environment with anchored which is fundamental to ensure that the achievement of low inflation even in face of adverse the copom members reiterated the importance of reaffirming the conduct of monetary policy with an exclusive focus on the evolution of inflation projections and the balance of and economic relative price shocks should be tackled only in the secondary impact they may have on prospective in they reiterated the importance of insisting on communicating that there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary the committee members reiterated once again their preference for communicating the conditionalities on the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to increase transparency and enhance in this they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of fiscal and adjustments in the brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the committee also notes that the perception of continuity in the reform agenda affects expectations and current macroeconomic the copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to the targets over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes the copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long for the reduction of its structural interest and for sustainable economic the committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic the copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and of the balance of and of economic shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible effects to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the it is through such effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and and change the balance of these effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary the copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural this stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy its balance of risks in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the selic rate at its current the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn carlos viana de carolina de assis costa de ribeiro paulo neves de reinaldo le sidnei and tiago couto monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index reached in percentage points above the one recorded in the previous as a inflation accumulated in months reached in june in june with market prices increasing by in june and regulated in june specifically regarding market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months through june in june and the prices of in june it bears noticing that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in twelve months through june in june and the prices of services rose in june in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services sector in the short the realignment process of regulated prices and temporary supply shocks in the food and beverages the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in may to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in june the double weight core inflation changed from in may to in the core by which excludes ten household food items and changed from to and the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and from to on its the trimmed means ipca core inflation remained at and the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to the diffusion index stood at in june above the one recorded in june the general price index increased in reaching on a trailing basis in june the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in june with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through june in june the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in june partially driven by pressures stemming from labor which changed in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in may the decreased and increased seasonally the composite purchasing index regarding brazil changed from in may to in indicating a pronounced contraction of the private sector after five consecutive the industry confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation increased between june and on their the consumer confidence index and the services confidence index decreased and regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the projected in june an increase of in the grains production in relative to the the industrial activity increased in after decreasing in according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the the industrial production accumulates a change of in the last twelve months until according to the observed industrial production decreased in the result was negative in the four use categories and in out of the surveyed according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased between april and according to the seasonally adjusted and it stood lower than the one registered in may the pmi of the industrial on its changed from in may to in among the use comparing may and april according to seasonally adjusted data the increase of in semi and goods presented the highest increase and interrupted seven consecutive months of negative capital goods with increase of also presented a positive rate in intermediate goods and durable goods presented decreases in their regarding there was a decrease in the production of the four capital goods durable consumer goods semi and consumer goods and intermediate goods according to the continuous national household sample survey the unemployment rate in the moving quarter ended in may was estimated at an increase of compared to the same period last according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate stood at in the figure represents increases of and of data released by the ministry of labor and employment showed reduction of thousand formal jobs in while thousand formal jobs were destroyed in the first six months of the in the set of available data confirm a softening process in the labor according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume decreased in on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction decreased in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted with retraction in seven of the ten sectors in twelve the retail sales growth rate fell by and the broad retail sales decreased the trade confidence index measured by the decreased between june and with no signs of improvement of the activity in the coming the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in july according to the seasonally adjusted among the industry use according to the seasonally adjusted the ones showing the highest nuci are intermediate goods and construction material followed by consumer goods durable consumer goods and capital goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through according to the ministry of industry and foreign trade the trailing trade balance surplus reached billion in june this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with retreats of and relative to the cumulative results through june on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in june equivalent to of the foreign direct investment to the direct investment liabilities totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators in the horizon relevant for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements restraining investments and regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced in the emerging they stand at relatively high the price of the brent oil barrel fell to levels around since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have fallen and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through june of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the june copom among other this projection considers the assumption of changes of in the price of in the price of bottled in fixed telephone tariffs and of in electricity the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for up from considered in the june committee the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at of the gdp for and of the gdp for it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the june meeting and remains above the inflation for according to both the baseline and the market the inflation forecast remained stable and above the inflation target set by the policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains with possible episodes of higher for the a more intense global activity trend prevails throughout the monetary policy relevant in this the prospects indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition and of moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights evidence of volatility sources in the currency and fixed income markets and moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and gdp growth rates continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the in the investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of and private consumption shows moderation in line with recent data regarding employment and for the after a necessary period of the activity expansion pace tends to as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint even if with lower the new trajectories regarding fiscal variables affected the expectations and asset in this the committee notes that significant changes in the trajectory of generation of primary surpluses impact the working hypotheses considered for inflation projections and can help to create a less positive perception of the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also highlights that a primary path that strengthens the perception of sustainability of the public sector balance contributes to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in stimulating private investment in the medium and long specifically regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong the consumer credit has so over the last it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by the recently implemented the committee considers as necessary the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the as anticipated by previous the copom highlights that the narrow idleness margin in the labor market has with data confirming the acceleration of a process of distension in this a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of wage increases incompatible with productivity with negative impacts over in spite of the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimates for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers over the first half of among other these relative prices ajustments in the among other have made the balance of risks to inflation unfavorable this in this as anticipated in previous these price adjustments cause inflation to rise in the short term and to tend to remain high in requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts on the committee reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the second order effects stemming from in order to limit them to given the assessing the macroeconomic the inflation prospects and the current balance of the copom unanimously decided to raise the selic rate by to without the committee understands that maintaining this level of the basic interest for a sufficiently long is necessary for the convergence of inflation to the target at the end of the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson otávio ribeiro damaso and sidnei corrêa the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the real state the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the for the the combined effects of these and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market this the recovery dynamics of regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by at the end of in this the copom believes that the convergence scenario of inflation to at the end of has for the the progress made in the fight against inflation like benign signals stemming from the medium and long term expectations indicators show that the monetary policy strategy is the right the remaining risks for the inflation forecasts to reach safely the goal of at the end of are consistent with the lagged and cumulative effect of monetary policy but require that the monetary policy remains vigilant in case of significant deviations of inflation forecasts from the at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on september for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index changed in percentage points above the one recorded in april and below the one recorded in march as a inflation in twelve months decreased to in

april in april the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in april partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics changed in april and in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimate for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in march changed seasonally composite purchasing

decreased in showing the greatest negative change at the margin since december with the sequence of falls started in january the index remains below the historical average for the consecutive the services confidence index also retreated in reaching the lowest level since april and featuring the biggest monthly decline since december regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the ibge in march indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the the industrial activity decreased in after being stable in according to the seasonally adjusted released by the according to the observed industrial production fell in the industrial sector accumulated increase of in the first three months of the the decline in industrial activity from february to march was characterized by negative reaching two of the four major economic categories and of the segments the pmi indicator for the industrial sector indicates contraction of the brazilian production in according to data released by the national confederation of industry the real earnings in the manufacturing industry fell from february to march according to the seasonally adjusted representing the largest monthly drop since november among the use capital goods and durable consumer goods reported in march more severe declines than the national average the intermediate goods production also decreased in this month and the semi and goods sector was the only one to post a positive rate regarding growth accumulated in the last twelve months through there were expansions in the production of capital goods and durable consumer goods the production of semi and consumer goods and intermediate goods also increased and according the same comparison according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate without seasonal adjustment reached in representing reductions of and according to the bcb seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached a record low for the still according to the the average real income increased in and the real payroll increased according to the same comparison data released by the ministry

situation as well as in the optimism for the following the average index for the quarter stood at the lowest for the historical series started in march the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in according to the seasonally adjusted series calculated by the the nuci in march reached among the use categories of the ones showing the highest according to the seasonally

regarding the global leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with advanced and emerging specifically about despite recent high unemployment rates coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties still constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary the federal reserve has continued the process of gradual reduction of the assets purchase program and by and accommodative stances prevail in the advanced in the emerging in the monetary policy is less inflation remains at moderate or low levels in advanced economies and at high levels in emerging the price of the brent oil barrel has remained at a level near since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have increased and those relative to metals have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations retreated in the twelve months through april of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected

recently released data have been less positive than the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have in there are improvements in advanced including countries from the euro in the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee also highlights despite recently observed localized the prospects indicate moderation in the dynamics of prices in the international as well as in the currency there is evidence of tension and the copom evaluates that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this compared to as well in the medium important changes must take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the copom notes that the expansion rates of domestic absorption have been higher than the gdp but both tend to in this the consumption tends to grow at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent and the investments tend to gain regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates in the long more favorable prospects for

observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables and the arising of the conditions so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation on the one would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also bears emphasizing that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum wage this year is not as significant as in the previous and considering the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor productivity over the recent the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for the resilience of this development is underpinned by two important relative prices adjustments processes now underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices in relation to market the committee recognizes that these in relative prices have direct impacts on inflation and reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from by the in order to fight these and other inflationary in the last twelve the monetary conditions were but the committee evaluates that the effects of the selic rates hikes on inflation in yet to it is plausible to claim in the presence of relatively low levels of the effects of monetary policy actions on inflation tend to be assessing the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the copom unanimously at this to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively on the one household consumption tends to record a moderate expansion due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial concession of public broadening of oil exploration among other tend to support the expansion of these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on july for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index reached in percentage points above the one recorded in the previous as a inflation accumulated in reached in market prices changed in in and regulated in among market the prices of tradable goods increased in in and the prices of in it should also be noted that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in in and the prices of services rose in in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in november to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in december the double weight core inflation changed from in november to in the core inflation by exclusion of regulated

diffusion index stood at in december below the one recorded in december the general price index increased in november and in reaching on a trailing basis in december the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in december with increase of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through december in december the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in december partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in november the decreased seasonally the composite purchasing index regarding brazil changed from in november to in suggesting contraction in on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation increased in despite the favorable development at the the index remains at historically low the services confidence index increased in december month on while the industry confidence index decreased in influenced by the deterioration in the current situation regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the ibge in december indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the the industrial activity decreased in after increasing in according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the as a the industrial production accumulates a fall up to november according to the observed the industrial production decreased in the result was negative in the four use categories and in out of the surveyed according to the same comparison according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry decreased between october and november according to the seasonally adjusted and is lower than the one observed in november the pmi of the industrial on its increased to in resuming among the use according to the november and seasonally adjusted data the production of durable consumer goods and semidurable and consumer goods recorded more significant the capital goods sector decreased while the intermediate goods sector remained regarding there was a decrease in production in the four durable consumer goods capital goods intermediate goods and semidurable and consumer goods according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate reached in the figure represents increases of compared to october and of compared to november data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were created in the worst figure for november since in the set of available data indicates narrow idleness margin in the labor although some data point to an accommodation according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume increased in compared to november on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and fell in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the retail sales growth rate was and the broad retail sales growth was with expansion in seven out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the decreased in reflecting dissatisfaction with the performance of this end of the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in december according to the seasonally adjusted among the industry use according to the seasonally adjusted the ones showing the highest nuci are construction material and intermediate goods followed by durable consumer goods capital goods and consumer goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through the trailing trade balance result reached billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with retreats of and on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators in the horizon relevant for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced in the emerging they stand at relatively high the price of the brent oil barrel decreased to levels below since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have fallen and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through december of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the december copom among other this projection considers the assumption of increases of in the price of to a great extent as a consequence of the contribution for intervention on the economic domain and of the participation program contribution and social security financing of in the price of bottled of in fixed telephone and of in electricity due to the passthrough to the tariffs of the costs stemming from the financing operations of the energetic development account contracted in the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for down from considered in the december the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at and of the gdp for and it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the december meeting and remains above the inflation for according to both the baseline and the market the inflation forecast remained relatively stable above the inflation target set by the policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the although in growth rates in important economies were lower than a more intense global activity trend prevails throughout the monetary policy relevant in this the prospects indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition and of moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the committee highlights evidence of volatility sources in the currency markets and moderation in the dynamics of commodities prices in the international regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and gdp have converged and that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential for the the activity expansion pace tends to intensify as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a moderate and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a composition for growth more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy regarding the supply the committee evaluates in the longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal the committee argues during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections will contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also highlights that this primary path will strengthen the perception of sustainability of the public sector this sustainability contributes to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in stimulating private investment in the medium and long specifically regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit important to highlight the fact after years of strong expansion cooled with the introduction of macroprudential measures at the end of the credit market oriented to consumption has so over the last quarters it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by the recently implemented the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum this is not as significant as in the previous and the occurrence of real wage changes is more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustments processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers since its last among other the intensification of the aforementioned adjustments in relative prices in the economy has made the balance of risks to inflation less in this the committee does not rule out the occurrence of a scenario that includes inflation in the short anticipates that inflation tends to remain high in but will enter already this year a long period of while recognizing that these adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts on the committee reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from given the above assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic rate by to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively robust in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to follow a moderate expansion due to factors such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial especially in the case of real estate the concession of public the broadening of oil exploration among other tend to benefit on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the for the these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target of established by cmn for the next the copom believes that the convergence scenario of inflation to in has for the the progress made in the fight against inflation like benign signals stemming from the medium and expectations indicators has not yet been at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on march for

leading released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to and the pmi coincident relative to signal improvements at the margin in several advanced and emerging especially in the manufacturing with prospects of growth in line with the trend or above regarding monetary the federal reserve has initiated process of gradual reduction of the assets purchase in accommodative stances prevail in the advanced in the emerging the monetary policy is inflation remains at moderate or low levels in the in the euro zone and in the price of the brent oil barrel slightly retreated since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have retreated while the ones relative to metals have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations have retreated in the twelve months through december of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following for the whole year of gasoline and bottled gas prices are projected to remain the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to an increase of for the whole year of the fixed telephone tariff is projected to remain stable for the whole year of the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated for the whole year of was maintained at the same value considered at the november copom and the projected cumulative adjustment for the set of regulated prices in corresponds to these projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the estimated path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis point and bps for the fourth

prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the november and also stands above the inflation for the inflation forecast stands above the target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation

also that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well

extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the supported on positive data recently the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have there are improvements in advanced including countries from the euro in the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international as well as of some tension and volatility episodes in the the copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses relatively stable domestic activity expansion pace in this compared to and that recent information in the relevant horizon for the monetary changes in the composition of aggregate supply an the domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than those observed for the gdp growth according to the it tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy of the moderate expansion of credit supply of credit to of the program of public services concession and of the program of permission of oil among other for the the outlook that has been taking shape is that consumption would tend to keep but at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent and investments would gain regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the growth of the brazilian focusing on the supply the committee evaluates that more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture are emerging considering the relevant horizon for monetary the services sector tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also notes that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and of their expected gains depends on the strengthening of companies and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables and the creation of conditions so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for the inflation on the one would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it should also be emphasized that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would help to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum wage this year is not as significant as in the previous and considering the occurrence over the recent quarters of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent quarters enable a natural and expected correction in relative for the these movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is also important to highlight for the the aforementioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the secondary effects stemming from and that would tend to materialize over longer can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show by the has been slightly above the level which was previously in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it is in this the copom considers that it is appropriate to continue the ongoing adjustment pace of the monetary continuing the adjustment process of the basic interest initiated at the april the copom at this decided to increase the selic rate by to without the following

horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the same the committee considers that

inflation averaged in the first quarter of the year in the same period of but decelerated in april and averaging this deceleration influenced similarly the behavior of two out of the three great the consumer price reached down from while the wholesale price index declined to down from on the other the civil construction national which averaged in the first quarter of the averaged in the two months ended in due to pressures stemming from raw material costs and wage in the last twelve months through the reached up from in the same period of in light of the elevation of the in the last twelve months through the increase in the same period to a large influenced by the and the incc which totaled and the acceleration was mainly driven by agricultural which increased while industrial prices only increased as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation despite recording some accommodation in industrial output continues to present robust growth on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output grew compared to the previous maintaining the growth pace observed in and registered the thirteenth consecutive compared to the same month of last industrial output grew the highest rate observed since june under this comparison reflecting the expansion in out of the activities in the last twelve industrial output expanded by with for manufacturing industry and for for the few leading and coincident indicators available for industrial production suggest the continuity of the ongoing the several incentive factors to economic including the monetary easing already suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall continue in the upcoming disaggregated industrial data showed seasonally adjusted expansion of in capital goods production and in the production of intermediate compared to the same month last capital goods production expanded by while intermediate goods production increased by according to the same comparison durable goods production increased by the dynamics of capital goods production reflects the consolidation of positive prospects for domestic demand growth and the influence of favorable international prices in some in the expansion of intermediate goods production in the first four months of the year suggests a more generalized acceleration in industrial in line with the usual seasonal pattern at the start of the the unemployment rate increased in the first months of to in march and april up from in december in the year through average unemployment rate stood below that observed at the same period last the purchasing power of workers increased according to the same comparison a record high for the real payrolls increased in the year through compared to the same period last an important factor sustaining the growth of aggregate according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in april and after totaling in reaching a record high for the series started in in manufacturing employment expanded by in compared to the same month of last regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirms the continuity of expansion in with the creation of thousand new jobs growth on a seasonally adjusted basis and thousand jobs in the last twelve as a in the year through as well as on a trailing formal job creation grew with highlights for civil construction and mining retail sales increased in after expansions of in february and in according to data seasonally adjusted by the with this retail sales expanded in the first compared to the same quarter of retail sales expansion reached in the first quarter of the outpacing the expansion recorded in the last quarter of for this robust performance of retail which indicates strong growth of domestic contributed both items more sensitive to payroll such as items of personal and domestic according to this comparison and those that are usually more sensitive to credit such as furniture and domestic appliances expansion in the expanded retail which include the sales of civil construction material and parts and increased in compared to the same month of the ninth consecutive month that expanded retail sales exceeded retail for the rest of the it is expected the continuity of retail sales boosted by the increase in employment and credit the monetary easing process and by the recovery of consumer installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry averaged in the year through up from in the same period of according to cni data without seasonal the installed capacity utilization according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the stood at in above that observed in the same month of and below the record high for the series observed in july according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the installed capacity utilization reached in a new record high for the disaggregated indicators calculated by cni indicated that out of sectors exceeded the average installed capacity compared to eleven sectors at the same month of last this dynamics reflects the intensification of economic although recent data relative to production and absorption of capital goods indicate that investment expansion remains in the year through the absorption of capital goods robustly increased compared to the same period of this result reflects the increase in capital goods imports in as well as capital goods production the production of inputs for civil construction increased in light of the recent installed capacity utilization the continuity of investment expansion will be essential to avoid relevant imbalances between aggregate supply and as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust confirming the evaluations based upon inflation reports and previous copom minutes that depict important structural changes in the brazilian foreign after reaching in a billion record a increase over the the trade balance continuous to register vigorous surpluses that encourage analysts to review positively their in the year through the trade surplus reached a increase relative to may exports rose to while imports increased to as observed in previous copom imports have been growing more rapidly than exports at the due not only to higher level of economic but also to the strengthening of the which points to a healthy adjustment process of the trade with regard to the international uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy stance in the us signals that inflation could be running above the fomc comfort zone indicate that expectancies of an easing cycle starting this year may have been additional interest rate increases in the us be the possibility of economic deceleration and its potential effects over the other worldwide economies cannot be on the other the strengthening of economic activity in europe and the continuity of the robust expansion of the major countries in asia have so far compensated for the moderate economic deceleration in the the maintenance of growth rates at historically high levels has caused higher inflationary pressures especially over raw materials and food in this context of robust global the economy and prices of brazilian assets have shown both remarkable resilience to the fluctuations in international financial thanks to the improvement in economic fundamentals in the recent and to a very benign behavior of export in this in addition to showing more resilience to changes in international markets the brazilian economy trails a growth cycle with price considering all this the copom continues to consider that the international scenario is oil another external source of rose since the last copom meeting and still present the recent levels of international prices of this commodity seem to be reflecting both structural shifts in global demand for energy and recurrent episodes of geopolitical despite significant risks inherent to forecasts on future oil prices the main scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in continues assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the april copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at the projection for electricity and fixed telephone price adjustments in were modified relative to the april the new projections for electricity and fixed telephone are and the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to from of the april copom these according to the weights released by the represent of the total may the projection for regulated prices inflation in was also to this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the estimates a bps in the fourth quarter of reaching bps in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the april copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group decreased to from this reduction was mainly driven by a decrease of inflation expectations for the third quarter of the ahead inflation expectations decreased to down from for inflation expectations remained at as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca reduced compared to the values considered at the april copom remaining below the target by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting situated below the values considered in the april copom meeting and below the central target for the the projection for based on the benchmark stayed relatively stable in relation to the april remaining below the under the market the projection still remains above the monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data point to strengthened demand but still do not suggest high probability of important pressures over inflation in the imports expansion has contributed significantly to this complementing domestic production limiting potential inflationary effects of aggregate demand sustained despite the uncertainties regarding the continuity of the strong growth recently observed in the international the prospects of lower liquidity in important international and the volatility increase in the global the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external the combination of significant trade surpluses and increasing capital inflows suggests that the balance of payments will continue to perform the prospects for the inflation trajectory remain as in recent the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the the copom evaluates that the more benign behavior of inflation in the recent in contrast with relatively high monthly rates that had persisted since the end of confirms the convergence of inflation trajectory to the targets the emergency of global inflationary pressures still does not present risks for the domestic inflation trajectory in the short but a heated demand could increase the of wholesale prices pressures to consumer in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in and expected for the next quarters of the the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions should have limited effects in and predominant impacts in in light of the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission the lower distance between the current selic rate and the equilibrium interest and the interest rate cuts implemented since september the copom members understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real demands a cautious monetary easing the copom evaluated since the last influences of internal and external factors on the balance of risks for the expected inflation trajectory and in opposite external acting importantly to widen aggregate continues to influence inflation prospects in a predominantly benign on the other expansion of domestic demand may increase the risks to inflation dynamics on the some participants of the committee understood considering the extension of the easing process already the remaining uncertainties regarding the lagged impacts of the monetary the expected behavior of the other sustaining factors of the such as income in a scenario of solid expansion of domestic demand for tradable and goods and and of economic activity the maintenance of the reduction pace in the selic target rate would contribute to extend the easing process over the majority of the committee argued that the contribution of the external sector for the consolidation of a benign outlook for inflation could be higher than previously especially by controlling the prices of tradable goods and by increasing investments in a heated demand such contribution is favoring the equilibrium between aggregate demand and domestic supply growth rates at a pace in line with monetary policy without compromising the convergence for the inflation targets five members of the committee understood that the risk balance to the evolution of future inflation would justify a reduction in the selic target given the reasons stated the copom decided to continue the monetary easing cycle and reduced the selic target rate to without five votes were for the copom monetary policy while two votes were in favor of reducing the selic target by basis under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to the despite the remaining uncertainties regarding the us the international scenario remains and benefits the external sector contribution for the maintenance of a benign inflationary on the other a set of price pressures arises when domestic demand expands the economic activity this expansion encompasses some sectors little exposed to external when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already are not fully in such the monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on july for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased in up from in accumulating growth in twelve in the year through the index increased above the rise recorded in the same period of this rise in may reflected distinct behavior among the large the main increases were for food and especially in natura personal especially household and as a result of seasonal in an opposite the lowest rates were for and due to the cooling of oil prices market prices inflation increased in up from in while regulated prices decreased totaled down from in the same in the last twelve market prices increased and

accumulating in the year through may and in twelve considering the main components of the the rate increase a result of the incc which reached in the up from in the previous the incc result was mainly driven by the increase in the cost of the due to wage readjustments in goiânia and são the increased in down from in while the prices totaled in down from in the previous the lower ipa inflation in may reflected the continuous reduction of agricultural despite at a lower and the cooling of industrial the agricultural ipa totaled in compared to in while the industrial ipa recorded and for the same the main negative drivers were legumes and sugar poultry and among agricultural and moisturized ethylic alcohol and among industrial the main pressures in may stemmed from the prices of in natura

a reduction in consultations to the usecheque system in on a in comparison to may there were increases of and regarding investment civil construction inputs production expanded in while capital goods domestic production fell seasonally capital goods contraction should not be interpreted as a trend in view of the and expansions registered in the first four months of and in the last twelve in the first four months of the capital goods production for mixed use increased by typically manufactured capital goods expanded by while capital goods production for energy and for civil construction grew and production of capital goods for agriculture expanded by in the same while the negative trailing production reduced to in compared to in confirming the upturn of the trend at the bndes funding for

in on a sales of overall automotive industry increased relative to may totaling thousand a monthly record as exports reduced by such performance was exclusively due to the domestic which increased a record high for the considering the seasonally adjusted domestic sales increased by while exports expanded by according to the the current estimate for the crops harvest in the period pointed to a compared to the previous national production of grains should reach million due to weather conditions and the production incentive driven by the increase of international agricultural commodities in the main forecast increases related to wheat cottonseed corn bean and soy while the main decreases related to coffee and rice production and it still bears emphasizing the increase in land occupation for sugar cane driven by the growing interest in ethanol sugar cane plantations increased by in and the production should expand by surveys and expectations the survey showed declines of in the consumer confidence index in and compared to may the current economic conditions index increased in while the consumer expectation index declined by in the icea remained above the iec for the fifth consecutive according to the fgv which encompasses two thousand homes in the seven main state capitals of the the icc increased in this result is due to the improvement in both the assessment of the

industry declined in after the record high observed in the ici rose relative to may totaling an expansion in the first four months of compared to the same period of this result is due to the positive

carried out by fgv in april of the companies surveyed affirmed that their investment in fixed capital is higher in the first half of than that observed in the previous while affirmed that their investment is the prediction of higher investment in the second half of also reached of the while of the companies intend to invest the main reasons to invest in fixed capital quoted by the firms the expansion of production capacity and the increase in production efficiency the high tax burden was the main factor for inhibiting investments in fixed totaling of the above the proportion registered

last twelve expansion also reached with highlights to the increase in civil construction employment and in commerce after seasonal employment increased in with increases in all according to the ibge employment survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate stayed unchanged at in april the unemployment rate stability reflects mainly the and decreases in employed population and economically active population the reduction of thousand employed workers was due to reductions of in the number of informal workers and in the number of civil and military servants and increase of in the number of workers in the private in the first four months of the average number of workers increased by relative to the same period of reflecting an expansion of investments and recovery of the agricultural among the workers in the private the number of formal workers increased by while the number of informal workers remained highlighting a qualitative improvement in the labor according to the same real average earnings reached in a increase and a elevation compared to april real payrolls decreased in reflecting the reduction in the number of formal but maintained a yearly rising

the process of economic baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment regarding the global the provision of additional monetary stimulus in major in a context of economic slowdown and has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging the outlook remains and risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global growth various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for and for this scenario among other a path for the selic rate that ends at and remains at that level until the end of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at and remains at that level until the end of in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for in the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for in the scenario with the interest rate path from the focus survey and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the july copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation on the other a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case the outlook for emerging economies discussion about the conduct of monetary copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available information and they concluded that the data released since their previous meeting suggest recovery of the brazilian economic resumption after growth in the second the committee expects gross domestic product to grow slightly in the third subsequent quarters should show some which should be reinforced by the stimuli resulting from the release of fgts and resources impacting the last quarter of in baseline inflation scenario assumes that the pace of underlying economic activity which excludes the effects of temporary stimuli will be copom members also evaluated the evolution of financial conditions they concluded that these conditions remained at favorable despite some volatility since the previous copom as a result of developments in international markets and of temporary impacts of the crisis in the environment with favorable financial conditions results from the increase in the degree of monetary the relatively favorable external environment for emerging economies and the prospects for improving the fundamentals of the brazilian as a result of the reform this easing of financial conditions has been more clearly reflected in the dynamics of credit and capital value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed during the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom copom members also discussed factors that could affect economic in the context of the deep adjustments that the brazilian economy notably those of fiscal in a context of limited fiscal they emphasized the importance of the continuation of the process of reforms and adjustments that contribute to the sustainability of fiscal by reducing fundamental uncertainties about the brazilian these reforms tend to stimulate private this potential expansionary effect should counterbalance the impact of current fiscal adjustments on economic as well as mitigate the risk of episodes of large increase in risk copom stressed the understanding that an acceleration of the pace of economic recovery to more robust levels will also depend on other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and development of the brazilian initiatives in the structural agenda of the banco central do brasil contribute to this regarding the global committee members deemed the scenario relatively favorable for emerging on the one central banks of several economies some major economies included have provided additional monetary which contribute to easing global financial on the other the copom judges that the risks associated with a slowing global economy remain and that economic policy and geopolitical uncertainties notably trade disputes and geopolitical tensions may contribute to even lower global uncertainties in the external scenario imply risks to assets whose pricing hinge heavily on a scenario with low global interest rates and the maintenance of the recent pace of economic in this the copom members once again highlighted the capability of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of anchored inflation and prospects of continuing structural reforms and of economic the committee members discussed recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying the latter measures are deemed to be at comfortable projections indicate that month inflation is expected to decline in the coming months and to at the end of the to levels around those observed until this trajectory among other the benign behavior of some volatile inflation components and the dynamics of imported whose upward drivers have been moderated by the path of prices in foreign in the relevant horizon for monetary scenarios with constant interest rates at result in inflation below the the true for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus in this the conditioning factors have opposite effects on inflation for on the one additional monetary stimulus from lower interest rates contributes to increasing inflation over the relevant on the other the scenario considers exchange rate appreciation in the short which constitutes a vector in the opposite the effects of the aforementioned currency appreciation become clear in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path from the focus survey and an agnostic hypothesis of constant exchange which projects inflation slightly below target in conditional projections for inflation in the various scenarios are also affected by the propagation of lower current committee members then discussed the since their previous of the factors highlighted in their balance of risks around the baseline inflation all members emphasized the importance of continuing the reform agenda and persevering in the required adjustments in the brazilian they also assessed that while the external scenario remained relatively favorable for the conduct of monetary policy in emerging the risk of adverse scenarios for risky assets appears to have copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at comfortable scenarios with inflation projected below or slightly below and high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate the committee members expressed the view that the current level of real interest rates provides stimulus to the the structural interest rate is a reference for the conduct of monetary when this policy yields a real interest rate below the structural it provides stimulus for economic activity and contributes to an increase in as the structural rate is not observable and economic activity and inflation depend on several other estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty and are continually reassessed by the at each the copom assesses whether the selic rate is at an appropriate considering all factors that affect the evolution of inflation projections and the balance of and economic under the aforementioned this implies evaluating whether the degree of monetary stimulus is it is worth highlighting that the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the copom reiterates its view that the continuity of reforms and perseverance in the necessary adjustments central do copom brazilian economy are essential for the reduction of its structural interest for the full operation of monetary and for sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic in the committee judges that concrete progress in this agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its july meeting they unanimously decided to lower the selic rate to the copom also discussed the advisability of providing some perspective on possible monetary policy the committee decided to express its assessment that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit additional adjustment of the degree of given the decision to clarify conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which best conveys the economic rationality that guides its the copom deemed it essential to emphasize that the communication of this assessment does not constrain its next and to reiterate that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on in the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes the copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural the copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian but emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential for the reduction of its structural interest rate and for sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic in the committee judges that concrete progress agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes adjusting the degree of monetary lowering the selic rate by percentage the committee deems that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit additional adjustment of the degree of the copom reiterates that communicating this assessment does not constrain its next and emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carlos viana de carolina de assis fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation remained virtually unchanged in march relative to in as a inflation reached in the first quarter of up from in the same period of trailing inflation continued to after reaching in it totaled in february and in march in march under this comparison the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which increased more rapidly than regulated in market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through compared to and in the twelve months through march despite the brl the prices of tradable goods reaching to in march according to the same comparison regarding greatly pressured by the behavior in the prices of perishable food and trailing inflation was even higher the recent behavior of ipca inflation has been remarkably less benign than that observed in previous so that since the end of inflation has signaled that it could be diverging from the targets reaching in the last six the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed divergent behavior in the first three months of the the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased from in january to in february the impact of seasonal elevation of education but retreated to in the smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures varied from and in january to and in and and in similarly to headline the three core inflation measures remarkably accelerated in the first quarter of the in comparison to the same period of with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core on a trailing the three core inflation measures following the behavior of headline core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased to in march up from in february and in smoothed trimmed means core inflation showed similar behavior in up from in february and in while the trimmed means core which tends to present less inertial increased to in up from in february and in still on a trailing inflation core despite remaining below the central currently stand at levels significantly higher than the record lows reached in the general price index inflation retreated to in down from in but accelerated to in on a trailing inflation accelerated to in up from in february and in january to in march in the twelve months through the increase reflected both the behavior of the consumer price which totaled in march and also of the price whose variation totaled in march according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in march regarding agricultural inflation reached in the twelve months through march it bears emphasizing the acceleration of industrial which began in the second half of and seems to have intensified in the first quarter of the industrial ipa increased up from in the same period of in the last twelve wholesale industrial price inflation increased to in up from in in january and in december as highlighted in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation after the last copom the ibge released gdp data for the fourth quarter of as well as the results for the whole the data showed significant acceleration of growth in the last quarter of according both to the accumulated change in the year up from in the third and to the change up from in the previous on the aggregate demand it bears highlighting the acceleration of gross fixed capital which grew especially the change in the expansion pace of domestic which tends to be less volatile than investment throughout the to up from according to the same comparison on the aggregate supply it bears noticing the acceleration of the services with up from in the previous on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after retreating in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the expansion observed in industrial output reduced in partially as a result of the technical interruptions in the pharmaceutical it bears mentioning that general industrial output and manufacturing output grew in the on a industrial output shows consistent growth in up from in january and in december the data already released for in to the continuity of the industrial production expansion which will continue to be favored by several incentive factors that influence economic such as employment and income the fiscal impulse in some the recovery of inventory among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital goods production increased significantly in february after stability observed in regarding other use it bears emphasizing the production of durable consumer which increased by in the scenario of solid expansion of capital goods production observed in mainly driven by the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of economic underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability seems to persist in this on its the dynamism of durable consumer goods production the remarkable improvement in credit when compared to historical it should be highlighted that the appearance of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production as suggested in some industrial indicates that possible reductions in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be associated to productive capacity labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey according to the seasonal to in february record low for the month in the historical up from in january and in as a the average unemployment rate in the first two months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate increased to in up from in remaining in levels close to the record low of the historical in average real earnings increased and as a real payrolls expanded by in in terms by in january according to the same comparison and continue to constitute a key driver for sustained aggregate demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment reduced by in february in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment at the start of the with the creation of thousand jobs in february from thousand in a record high for the month and for the first period of the formal employment grew by in the seasonally observed data point to a expansion in formal employment in the highest rate recorded since april according to this comparison an evidence of strong dynamism in the labor the services sector presented the highest hiring with the creation of thousand new followed by the manufacturing industry the best performance of the series for the and civil construction the retail sector recorded thousand new the agricultural sector created thousand new a record high for the due to the activities related to sugar cane plantations in the region and to the soybean in line with the positive developments in labor market and with credit retail sales continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and signs of cooling cannot be despite the decrease in according to data seasonally adjusted by the retail sales grew showing acceleration at the it bears highlighting the expansion in the sales of and domestic the steady growth of retail sales has reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit the expanded retail which also include the sales of parts and and increased in according to series seasonally adjusted by the and for the next the continuity of the current expanding cycle is and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high sector for relative to automobile sales in the first quarter of the corroborate this the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in unchanged relative to according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the and remained close to the record high of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the the nuci in the manufacturing industry reached down from the record high observed in without the seasonal the nuci in february stood above the level registered in the same month of the average rate of the first period of the year was above the level observed in the same period of the quarterly nuci calculated by fundação getulio vargas reached in according to the observed above the level registered in march for the consumer capital goods and civil construction material the utilization rates in march were and above those observed in the same month of the reduction of idle in relation to the margins usually occurs in several sectors despite the significant increase of in february according to seasonally adjusted the absorption of capital goods increased firmly due to the vigorous growth of capital goods imports in and capital goods production the production of civil construction inputs increased in the same showing robust recent data indicate although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization it has not been sufficient to contain this in this the timely maturation of investment projects will be crucial to limit mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand in the relevant forecast period for monetary as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust compared to historical despite the already expected deceleration at the in line with assessments present in inflation reports and previous copom minutes about important structural changes in brazilian foreign in the last twelve months through march the trade surplus reached billion below march exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust economic activity in the despite the increases in the prices of several commodities included in the brazilian export the decrease in trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through february equivalent to of foreign direct investment reached billion in the same equivalent to of regarding the external the process of economic deceleration in the us has as evidenced by the economic activity data in the last quarter of and first quarter of but uncertainties regarding its magnitude and duration still more recent data about the housing market and consumer goods as well as confidence indices and other leading point to a significant uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the us subprime mortgages market crisis over us and european financial institutions and over credit conditions for households and despite the dominant opinion still seems to point out to a but possibly intense the negative assessments have become more these assessments to some uncertainties about the capacity of the monetary policy stance implemented by the central bank in the to which fiscal incentives will be to smooth in a timely manner the us economic in light of persistent difficulties in the financial despite the reduction of systemic risk due to the federal reserve stance and the recapitalization of important such on their could be worsened by a cyclic deterioration in credit which would reinforce the already evident trend to financial increasing the risk of slowdown prospects for economic activity in europe and notwithstanding some favorable indicators in have also despite not provoking the same degree of concerns that surround the us economic on the other strong economic growth in main asian emerging which so far have been apparently little affected by the us mortgage has offset the effects of economic deceleration in mature in pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging many of which are consequently in the midst of monetary tightening for mature prospects for monetary policy are more economies presenting more moderate inflationary pressures and more evident credit contraction tend to present additional monetary policy on the other in economies where inflation rates are at high levels relative to their respective the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more in this volatility and risk aversion indicators in international financial markets have remained at quite high levels since the last copom showing some contraction at the even if the prices of brazilian assets at different sensitivity to the international brazilian economic activity does not seem to have been significantly impacted by the persistent deterioration on global financial markets despite not decoupled from external economic brazilian economy should sustain its growth essentially driven by domestic oil systematic source of uncertainty stemming from the international once more increased substantially since the last copom meeting and continue highly this behavior reflects structural changes in global energy which have blocked the recovery of inventory levels traditionally in addition to recurrent geopolitical despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil prices the main scenario considered by the copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in despite the probability of materialization of an alternative scenario has apart from the behavior of domestic gasoline one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts domestic economy both through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of inflation the prices of other especially which have also increased significantly since the last copom despite more pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and the turmoil on global financial decreased last but continue to record significant increases in the assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the assumptions considered in the march copom projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices were both maintained at for compared to the assumptions considered in the march copom the projections for electricity price adjustments in were set at down from while projections for fixed telephone prices were maintained at the projection for regulated prices based on individual was maintained at for this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total march the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the swap rates replacing the model based on the selic and swap estimates a spread in the fourth quarter of under the benchmark the swap rate trajectory points to a spread in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of of gdp for the consolidated public sector primary surplus in and adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the march copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased significantly to up from ahead inflation expectations increased to from considering the composition of median monthly inflation market for inflation expectations increased to up from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased compared to the value considered at the march copom above the target established by the national monetary council for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the value considered at the march copom and is also above the central target for the the projection for based on the benchmark scenario increased relative to the march copom whilst the projection based on the market scenario decreased in both projections are above the monetary policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion continues quite showing acceleration in some segments and regions in the first quarter of and is at least for the inflationary pressures observed in the despite strong imports growth and the benign investment even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since the committee according to available that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflationary on the other there are signs that relevant inflationary pressures are intensifying both in mature and emerging evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global the copom reaffirms the stated in previous that an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration represents an ambiguous risk factor for the brazilian on the one by reducing net exports it would act as a factor to restrain aggregate the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic on the other the alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two in the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets risk aversion could resulting in decreased demand for brazilian assets and depreciation of their in in the medium a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain brazilian due to the deterioration of inflation in a more uncertain the committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign inflationary scenario the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last monetary policy should act so that impacts initially focused on price indices do not result in persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics through a worsening in the copom considers that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has because the heated demand and market of in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the committee understands that the prospects for this as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price depend in a critical manner on inflation which increased significantly in the recent and continue to be carefully it is worth noticing that although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the for such as in the services in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as inflation expectations within the forecast promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario where adjustments become persistent or generalized price the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longlasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the continuous progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets for this to it is important that inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and converge during the relevant time for monetary the committee once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit growth and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the factors that will sustain these issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of and in the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive this together with the external has helped to mitigate inflationary which would be even more intense in their the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by fiscal transfers and by income and credit continues to present risks to inflationary in this the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand is even more relevant to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and has proved to be the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and that is the reason why variables such as inflation the balance of risks associated to the scenario and especially the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so at the current characterized by the deterioration in current and expected inflationary prudence assumes an even more important role in this in the current there is the risk is that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary the backed by international is that the performance of monetary policy tends to be more effective to reach their goals more when the deterioration of inflationary dynamics is in its early rather than when it is the copom evaluates in light of signals of economy as illustrated by the acceleration of some wholesale prices and the evolution of core inflation and by the fast increase in inflation the risks for the concretization of a benign inflationary in which ipca would remain consistent with the targets are in the deterioration of the scenario is already present in the inflation the copom also considers that the persistence of the mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand tends to increase the probability of such scenario to in these monetary policy should act through the adjustment of the basic interest rate in order on the one contribute to the convergence between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and and on the other avoid that inflationary pressures initially focused on price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation by remaining ready to act as the balance of risks to inflation dynamics so the committee believes that it in helping to sustain economic which requires predictability and consequent extension of the planning horizon for businesses and as well as to protect the substantial increases in real income of workers observed in recent in this evaluating the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and inflation the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic target rate to without the committee understands that the decision to promptly implement significant part of the adjustment in the basic interest rate will contribute to the timely reduction in the risks for the inflation the magnitude of the total adjustment to be under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its domestic demand continues to expand activity including sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive factors are still on its the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary in light of robust domestic demand seems to become less at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority should act so that to avoid that uncertainties contaminate longer time if the risk profile deteriorates in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective the committee will promptly adjust monetary policy stance to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on june for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september of data analyzed by the copom inflation ipca inflation increased in up from in february and in march in the first quarter of the ipca inflation reached up from on a trailing the ipca increased in up from in food prices increased in up from in previous contributing to the monthly ipca housing and which increased by and contributed both to the ipca monthly market prices increasing down from in while regulated prices registered inverse with a up from in the previous on a trailing basis through market prices expanded by and regulated up from and in the previous amongst market in the last twelve the prices of tradable goods increased to in up from in while the prices of goods to down from following the same trend of the prices of which increased in down from in according to the same comparison trimmed means core inflation measures accelerated for seasonal the core excluding household food and regulated prices decelerated in while on a trailing basis the three measures compared to the core excluding household food and regulated prices increased in down from in totaling in the last twelve months highest rate since may and up from in the previous the smoothed trimmed means core increased in up from in totaling in the last twelve the trimmed means core increased in up from in accumulating in the last twelve also the highest rate since may inflation increased in up from in accumulating in the first quarter of the year and in the last twelve the three index components accelerated in the with highlights to food both at wholesale and consumer inflation increased up from in the previous totaling in the last twelve inflation increased in after stability in accumulating in twelve incc inflation increased in up from in reaching in twelve the acceleration reflected the behavior of five out of the seven with highlights to food up from and housing up from at the wholesale both agricultural and industrial prices increased in highlighting the elevations in the prices of composed iron in natura while corn and poultry were the main negative activity according to monthly survey retail sales increased in february with generalized growth sales in all mainly driven by computing and communication equipment and material other items for domestic and personal use furniture and home appliances magazines and stationery and orthopedic and perfumery items expanded retail which include the activities parts and and construction increased influenced by the expansions of in the automotive sector and in construction retail sales declined in seasonally recording growth in the sales of and communication material and and declines in clothing and shoes and supermarkets food beverages and tobacco and orthopedic and perfumery items expanded retail sales increased in seasonally as a result of increases in the sales of vehicles and motorcycles and construction material according to são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the the consultations to the usecheque system and database consultations for credit sales in march and there were respective increases of and in the first quarter of these indicators increased and compared to the same period of regarding investment the production of construction inputs and domestic production of capital goods increased by and in seasonally these indicators grew and still according to this comparison the positive evolution of capital goods production reflects mainly the good performances in the following agricultural equipment equipment linked to investment in such as transportation equipment construction and energy capital goods imports increased in according to data from fundação centro de estudos do comércio exterior seasonally adjusted by the confirming the expansionist trajectory of investments in brazilian capital goods imports increased cni seasonally adjusted by the showed expansion of industrial activity in with increases of in industrial real revenues and in hours worked in compared to february and the first two months of industrial real revenues increased and and hours worked in and in the same installed capacity utilization reached in remaining relatively stable seasonally and increased according to the observed according to monthly industrial survey on a industrial production decreased in while the moving average remained these results were influenced by the decline in monthly pharmaceutical which responds for approximately of industrial reflecting the effects of technical interruptions in an important company in the fourteen out of the twenty seven activities surveyed recorded production increase in february by use the production of capital goods and durable consumer goods increased by and the

increases of billion in the month and compared to the end of market and open market operations in the period between the march and the april copom the yield curve shifted upwards in all with a slope this movement was mainly driven by the economic perception about the march copom minutes and the quarterly inflation the release data for inflation above market the increase of inflation expectations

continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment global outlook remains with risk appetite towards emerging economies at levels below those seen early this the main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and expectations for remain around inflation projections in the scenario with selic and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at increases to over the course of and remains at that level until the end of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at at and at in this the inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for for and for in this the inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the september copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both but with greater weight on the last two listed on the one the high level of economic slack may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies the committee judges that the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks has diminished since its previous discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available they concluded that the data indicate continuation of the recovery of economic at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this regarding the global the committee members considered that it remains challenging for emerging they evaluated since their previous risk appetite for assets of these economies stabilized in contrast with the worsening trend observed in the previous the assessment was that this stabilization occurred at levels lower that those observed at the beginning of the which implies higher risk in since the previous copom prices of risky assets in some advanced economies have shown greater which contrasts with the favorable evolution observed the baseline scenario assumes gradual normalization of monetary policy in central the committee members also mentioned the risks to the continued expansion of international with possible impacts on global and on the chinese in in this the copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of payments and the environment value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom bank of copom inflation expectations and prospects of economic the members of the committee also highlighted the reduction of uncertainties in the domestic which led to a decline in risk premia embedded in brazilian asset this decline of uncertainties contributed to reduce the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks for despite this the copom members concluded that upward risks to inflation continue to have a greater weight in the balance of the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory for the next this trajectory should lead to a rise of month reaching a peak around the second quarter of inflation is expected to decline over the remainder of towards the regard to underlying in recent months its various measures have risen from levels considered to be reaching levels that the committee deems appropriate generally consistent with the inflation recent changes in relative in a context of anchored inflation seem to have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation without posing risks to the maintenance of inflation at these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken the committee members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms along with the anchoring of inflation expectations should be monitored in order to evaluate possible more enduring effects from recent shocks to inflation their copom members then discussed the convenience of maintaining in their official documents the message on principles for conducting monetary policy in face of relative price shocks in an inflation targeting regime with anchored the copom has communicated in this monetary policy should focus only on possible effects of relative price changes induced by occasional it has also stressed that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be monetary policy will follow the same whether in face of inflationary shocks in the case of a shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange or in face of disinflationary shocks in the case of a favorable food price committee members pondered that it should already be clear that there is no mechanical relationship between shocks that produce relative price adjustments and monetary they agreed to exclude this message as of their next with the understanding that this should not be interpreted as a change in the conduct of monetary the members of the committee also discussed the extent of the exchange rate in the brazilian they assessed with the exception of some administered the level of has been the members that the intensity of depends on several such as the level of economic and the degree of anchoring of inflation the committee will continue to monitor different measures of exchange rate through to both inflation and underlying copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at adequate inflation projections close to the target for and and high level of slack in the economy still prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of the committee members expressed the view that the current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary all members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic conditions in on inflation the level of economic the balance of and inflation the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the committee assessed that this stimulus should be removed gradually if the prospective scenario for inflation at the relevant horizon its balance of risks copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its september meeting they unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary despite the reduction in the degree of asymmetry of the balance of all members considered that the current environment prescribes retaining greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary which requires refraining from providing indications of the next steps of monetary the members of the copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order bank of copom the path for prospective inflation in line with inflation this requires flexibility to gradually adjust the conduct of monetary policy when and if this ability to respond to different circumstances contributes to the maintenance of the environment with anchored which is fundamental to ensure that the achievement of low inflation even in face of adverse the committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to increase transparency and enhance in this they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of fiscal and adjustments in the brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the committee also notes that the perception of continuity in the of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic the copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and of the balance of and of economic shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible effects to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the it is through such effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and and change the balance of these effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored at the there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural this stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy its balance of risks in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks

maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with a smaller copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian

de assis costa de ribeiro paulo neves de reinaldo le sidnei and tiago couto the indicators released since the last copom meeting presented additional evidence that economic activity has stabilized in the measure of investment in the national accounts showed the first increase after ten consecutive quarters of there are signs of a possible gradual recovery in economic such as the expectations components of confidence expectations for growth compiled in the focus and expansion of industrial the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment regarding the external the scenario still presents a benign period for emerging reflected in the behavior of asset the dynamics of the global economic recovery remain with uncertainty regarding growth and deflationary risks in major developed recent manifestations of members signaled the possibility of further interest rate increases in the short generating uncertainties about the effects of a possible resumption of the normalization process of monetary conditions in the united returning to the domestic price indexes showed inflation exceeding expectations in the short due to food price increases to more persistent these results contributed to an additional increase in expectations for inflation measured by the focus which stood at around as for ipca inflation expectations reported in the same survey have declined by approximately percentage point since the last copom to around the conditional in the scenarios for inflation produced by the committee remained unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the previous copom gross domestic federal open market extended consumer price the copom uses the term to emphasize that the forecasts in the reference and market stable or retreated over the relevant for monetary for regulated the committee forecasts an increase of in lower than the forecast in the july copom for the current forecast of a increase in regulated prices is higher than the forecast in the last copom the revision for is primarily due to the forecasts for increases in electricity tariffs and urban bus fares the reference scenario among other that the interest rate and exchange rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast horizon per annum and the market scenario considers the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the focus in this scenario assumes exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rates of and at the end of the same for the projections under the reference and market scenarios were revised from approximately to around despite this the baseline scenario continues to contemplate disinflation in the brazilian economy in the upcoming for disinflation towards the target occurs under the assumptions of the reference in the market the projection stands around although disinflation in this scenario occurs at slower pace than the one pursued by the this forecast decreased relative to forecast at the july copom one of the factors that contributed for this reduction was the favorable evolution of inflation expectations compiled by the focus depend on assumptions for the future paths of the policy rate and the exchange among other the copom uses the term for the conduct of monetary policy to refer to the period of time until a change in monetary conditions implemented at a given point in time attains its maximum estimated effect on given the uncertainties involved in these this expression should not be perceived as referring to a rigid central do brasil risks around baseline inflation scenario there are risks to inflation in the increase in food prices wholesale prices already show some signs of with the transmission of wholesale into retail it is possible that a reversion of these prices at the consumer level decreasing risks of secondround effects of this shock on other prices in the on the one prolonged periods of high inflation and such as in the recent brazilian tend to reinforce inertial mechanisms and make the disinflation process slower and in this greater inflationary persistence requires greater monetary policy on the other the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity in produce faster disinflation for in the services sector than the one reflected in the inflation expectations measured by the focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the the implementation of the necessary adjustments in the including those of fiscal presents itself as both a risk and an opportunity for the ongoing disinflationary the risks would materialize if there were a perception that adjustments would be abandoned or postponed in this the disinflationary process would tend to be increasing the costs of bringing inflation to on the other the necessary adjustments in the economy can be approved and implemented more enabling confidence gains and falling inflation in this the reduction of uncertainty would boost the effects of the ongoing monetary adjustment discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members agreed that there was improvement in the macroeconomic scenario and that recent indicators show somewhat clearer evidence of economic activity there are signs of possible gradual pickup in economic this perspective is corroborated by the improvement in forwardlooking indicators of economic and by industrial production and investment regarding the committee members mentioned results that printed above expectations in the short and the increase in projections for in this they reasoned that the ongoing disinflation process has been evolving at a speed that is below the one pursued by the all agreed that there was progress with regards to expectations and projections over longer the fall in measures of inflation expectations collected by the focus survey for and more distant which are already around the and the fall of projections for under the assumptions of the market scenario were regarding the international some committee members pointed out that the period since the last meeting in fact offered a relatively benign environment for emerging which may the recent increase in uncertainty regarding the process of normalization of monetary policy in the united states increases the risk of interruption of this benign in this all committee members agreed on the need to monitor the pace of monetary policy normalization in the united states and its possible implications for the speed of inflation there was also consensus on the continuation of the medium and long term risks in the external associated with the fragility of the global economic in some major developed factors may still constitute unlikely but with significant adverse impacts all members of the monetary policy committee emphasized that the continuation of efforts for approval and implementation of adjustments in the especially with regard to fiscal is essential to the development of the brazilian the committee should monitor these efforts since they have important implications for the disinflation there was no consensus on the speed of these which suggests that they at the same both a risk and an all members agreed that the implications of the adjustment process in the economy for inflation dynamics depend not only on the impact of short term measures on aggregate but also on the perception of improved dynamics of public finances in the medium and long the members of the committee highlighted that the fiscal adjustment process may involve measures with unfavorable direct effects on which is a risk to be debate on the balance of risks to inflation also focused on the degree of confidence regarding the ongoing disinflation for shorter the emphasis fell on central do brasil in the short and on the increase in conditional forecasts for the current year produced by the for longer the committee members discussed the effects of the level of spare capacity in the in they highlighted the possible implications of the current scenario for the sensitivity of services inflation to the economic the committee also discussed the implications of specifying economic conditionalities for monetary policy going in contrast to the communication currently in which might be understood as involving a time the committee concluded for a given monetary policy conditioning the future evolution of monetary policy on factors that matter for inflation can better transmit the economic rationality that guides the this contributes to increase transparency and to improve copom all committee members showed satisfaction with the progress in the prospects for disinflation in the brazilian economy in the relevant horizons for monetary at the same they expressed concern with inflation expectations for as measured by the focus and with the forecast for inflation in market scenario both of which are above the target of monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of risks and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the committee judges that a loosening of monetary conditions will depend on factors that allow greater confidence on meeting the inflation targets at the relevant horizons for the conduct of monetary in particular the target for the committee emphasizes the following domestic that the persistence of the impacts of the food price shock on inflation be that ipca components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic slack show disinflation at an appropriate that the uncertainty regarding the approval and implementation of the necessary economic adjustments be including the composition of fiscal and their effects on the committee will assess the evolution of the combination of such the committee anticipates that the assessment of the impacts stemming from the evolution of these factors on the prospects for inflation will involve judgement based on available there is no factor that is by itself determinant for monetary policy in other neither of these factors is a necessary nor sufficient condition for an easing of monetary the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes luiz edson otávio ribeiro reinaldo le sidnei corrêa marques and tiago couto after recording in monthly inflation measured by ipca reached in as a trailing inflation reached in may in april and in above inflation registered in the twelve months through may the inflation increase in this period reflected both the behavior of market which increased in the same period of as regulated which increased in the same period of regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached and goods services price inflation continues at high levels in the period through may it reached the highest level since august in the set of available information suggests that prices acceleration observed in process led by market shows some in part because services inflation remains at high in the first five months of ipca increased above inflation observed in the same period of the main contributors were transport and personal that increased and compared to and in the same period of these items were responsible for of the headline inflation in the food and beverage was below that observed for in the first five months of the twelve months ended in food and beverage prices continue to play a relevant role in the headline inflation accumulating in the recent increase in food prices in domestic and external supply heightened by the high liquidity environment in international financial markets and by global demand each of the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb performed similarly to the headline while there was stability in the accumulated inflation until as compared to the previous average monthly rates retreated between march and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in march to in and in the double weight core after registering in decreased to in april and to in while the core inflation by exclusion went from in march to in april and to in the average change of the three core measures changed from in march to in and to in in the period until the three core measures registered and compared to and in and and in the ipca diffusion which had reached in retreated to in but increased again in may and continues to show a spreading price the general price index inflation retreated strongly in registering compared to in in the period through may it accumulated above the registered in the same period through may under this the index has been slowing since december when it recorded a inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in twelve reflecting an increase of in the industrial ipa and in the agricultural in the breakdown according to the production raw material prices accumulated intermediate goods and final goods in the same inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through may above the recorded until may according to the same comparison the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in may the producer price calculated by that measures the industry price level excluding freights and registered increase in compared to in march and in in twelve this index decreased to in from in as emphasized in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the ibge released information about the data showed expansion in which increased in the first and according to seasonally adjusted on the aggregate demand household consumption and public administration consumption and gross fixed capital formation increased whereas exports increased and imports grew according to the same comparison it is noteworthy that the investment rate reached slightly higher than the rate recorded in the first quarter of the imports and domestic production of machinery and equipment contributed to higher according to the result accumulated in the last four the contribution of domestic demand to gdp growth fell from in the to in the while the negative contribution of external sector decreased from to on the aggregate supply according to the comparison all the sectors the industry grew by agriculture and the services sector the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the grew in after increasing in february and in january and as consequence showed a increase in a moderation in the growth rate trend persists in the accumulated in twelve reducing from in february to in towards sustainable the services confidence index from in the in after increasing in april and retreating in therefore the level of this index in may was higher than that measured in may and the average index in the first five months of was below the average in the same period of industrial activity showed retraction in with a decrease in the industrial according to data seasonally adjusted by the after recording an increase of in march month when was hit a new record high and in the moving average growth rate reached in the period between february and standing at a level below the growth measured in the period from january to the industrial output retreated in april and in the last twelve output increased in down from in continuing the process of growth since december month with the lowest output level during the the growth accumulated until april was the recovery dynamics was partially supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the all the output categories in april showed intermediate goods decreased capital goods and consumer goods durable consumer goods in twelve months through april intermediate goods output increased and consumer goods output increased and durable consumer goods output grew according to the same comparison capital goods industry activity growth is the highest among use with a evidencing the investment a relevant factor for economic recovery in the postcrisis the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed decreased from in march to in below the level registered in april after reaching in march the observed data not only significantly reduced until april but reached a record low for the month since the start of the series in march the seasonally adjusted rate registered in a decrease compared to measured by the number of employed workers in the six biggest metropolitan increased in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate growth in formal employment in eleven out of the twelve last in thousand jobs were created thousand in april while in march thousand jobs were services and manufacturing industry were the sectors that mostly contributed for the formal employment increase in according to real average earnings observed in april decreased and increased as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand according to the retail monthly survey from expanded retail sales decreased in after recording a growth in february and in according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales showed increase of in after reducing in february and in average sales growth rate in the first quarter of accelerated to it also bears noticing that accumulated growth rate decelerated to in march in according to the last two comparison all ten sectors surveyed expanded in with by for vehicles and parts and pieces and furniture and appliances in the next the retail trajectory will continue to be benefited by governmental real payroll consumer confidence and an even more moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal changed from in april to in these values are lower than the levels observed in the same period of according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci kept unchanged in in the nuci is higher at construction inputs and intermediate goods at the construction intermediate and capital goods showed increases in nuci and while consumer goods decreased according to the confederation of national industry data seasonally adjusted by the the nuci in april reached down from in in installed capacity utilization rates have shown relative at high the high occupation level reflects the recent expansion in economic whose effects have not been totally offset by the maturity of investment in this the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through while construction inputs production for civil construction increased as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance result in the last twelve months increased from billion in april to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and compared to the period ended in may current account deficit accumulated in twelve months changed from billion in march to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding the needs for external the global economy recovery follows different speeds and asymmetrical inflation there are of activity moderation at the due to the developments of the disaster in the uncertainties about the us the high price of as well as the effects of monetary tightening in important emerging in the compound leading indicator released by the organization for economic and development for signaled world recovery continuity in but with a certain moderation in emerging on the other the purchasing managers index for the global that shows the industry and service sector activity after in the highest level since reduced to lower levels in march april and may the disaggregated pmi indicators evidence lower dynamism in the us and in the euro without affecting the positive the macroeconomic prospects for the euro zone continue to exhibit strong while some economies remain impacted by the insolvency risk and subject to strong fiscal the pace of expansion remains strong in other like regarding monetary mature economies continued to show very accommodative monetary inflation rate cores are still at moderate levels in the group euro zone and for the emerging there are widespread inflationary pressures and since the last copom meeting there were renewed monetary tightening in several emerging in the bank of china raised reserve requirements to banks once reaching the eighth increase in reserve requirements since october as well as four increases in the reference interest rates for deposits and brent oil prices showed volatility and remains above a level lower than the observed at the copom last this price level is consistent with a framework of apparent strengthening of the global demand as well as of political instability in some countries of the middle east in north it highlighting that geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten price which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the moderation of agricultural and metallic commodities after months of relevant in the pricing rules of major international mining companies for iron ore in the third quarter should lead to price the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers remained stable in may but remains at high levels compared to that observed in the same month last in recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to fx markets of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline accumulated for grew to from the considered in the april copom partial reversal of the increase of occurred up to whereas the adjustments for bottled gas for the same were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity rates in were kept at and the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual according to the benchmark was increased to against considered in the april this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total may the projection for regulated prices inflation in according to the benchmark was decreased to down from considered in the april such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and respectively regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of billion of without in to parameters contained in the budget guidelines law a primary surplus of billion around of is considered for according to budget guidelines law project including the effect of the minimum wage increase projected for the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements changes announced in december since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased from to for the median of inflation expectations moved from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians for the ipca changed from and to e for the medians changed from and to and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relatively to the figure considered at the april copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also decreased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projection remained stable in both the benchmark and the market and remained above the midpoint target in both in an alternative that considers the maintenance of the exchange during the forecast at levels observed in the recent and the interest trend collected by the projected inflation is above the target for and around this value for policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation targeting regime stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the reduction of both fx and inflationary risk among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has been increasing in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy the copom observes in international volatility and risk aversion have increased since the last mostly fueled by the extraordinary levels of liquidity and increasing uncertainty regarding the recovery of global in this increased the concerns about european sovereign and banking debts and the possible slowdown in economic activity in prices of important commodities mainly agricultural at the same some stability in the us currency was in the perspectives for brazilian economy external financing remain in other the price indices path shows clear dissemination of inflation pressures in the main the copom evaluates although moderation of domestic demand growth is yet at an uncertain prospects for economic activity are favorable as even suggested by preliminary information about the pace of economic growth in this this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidences stand at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the among other the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and substantial growth of real the copom evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario show more favorable signs since the last in the last quarter of and in the first quarter of inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply evidences suggest that consumer prices have already incorporated substantial part of the direct effects of these also relevant were the direct effects of the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments in the first quarter of the year in specific show signs of the committee considers that these effects shall still impact consumer prices among other through at the same it as risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth despite the signs that this mismatch tends to it highlights the narrow idleness margin of the production especially labor and analyzes in such a very important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and its negative impact on the inflation it is also relevant to notice the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory in international despite recent signs of have been presenting surrounded by great the copom considers two distinct moments for inflation according to the main in this quarter and in the inflation accumulated in twelve months tends to remain at levels above those observed in the first in great is explained by the high inertia that stemmed from by the duration of the shocks that hit the economy at the end of last that extended to the first quarter of this and by the fact that the projections of inflation for the quarter point to average inflation rates above those registered in the same period in from the fourth quarter the main scenario indicates a downward trend for the inflation accumulated in twelve moving toward the target the copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation besides contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend in the public it bears highlighting since the beginning of this important decisions have been taken and which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is in the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit for which macroprudential and traditional monetary policy actions recently adopted still about this the committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies regarding the credit in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which an uncertainty level and identifies risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation promptly converges to the midpoint since the last copom at the external evidence shows moderation in the recovery process experienced by the economies in another still reveals ambiguous influence on the behavior of domestic regarding the domestic macroprudential actions conventional monetary policy actions recently implemented will still have their effects incorporated to price although growing uncertainties that surround the global outlook at a minor the domestic do not allow the clear identification of the degree of persistence of recent inflationary the committee evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario shows more favorable in this continuing the process of monetary conditions gradual the copom to increase the selic rate to without considering the risks balance for the the pace still uncertain of the domestic activity as well as the complexity that affects the international the committee understands that the implementation of adjustments in monetary conditions by a sufficiently prolongued period remains the most adequate strategy to guarantee the inflation convergence to the target in domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although recent initiatives point to constraint in public sector fiscal and credit incentives provided to the economy in the last quarters shall still contribute for the activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness level of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial by the recent macroprudential actions by conventional monetary policy actions taken this these elements and the fiscal and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on july for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established

slightly reduced its with elevation in the overnight rates and retreat in the rates higher than a the movement of the short part of the curve the market expectation that the monetary tightening cycle will be at the long part of the the drop in rates was by the deceleration of various indices of by the decrease observed in the collection of price data and by the dissemination of more moderate activity in the external the signs of weakening global particularly the and the retreat in commodity prices also contributed to the reduction in domestic between april and june and interest rates

released since the last copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short run and a gradual recovery of economic activity during the course of if sustained over a long high levels of uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy can have detrimental effects on economic the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment stronger global economic activity has so far mitigated the effects on the brazilian economy of possible changes of economic policy in central inflation developments remain disinflation is widespread and includes ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary it is necessary to monitor possible impacts of higher uncertainty on the prospective path of inflation expectations collected by the focus survey are around for for and for and longer the path of administered prices underlying the inflation scenarios produced by the committee assumes increases of for and for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rates of per annum at the end of the same under these the inflation projection for is around the projection for in this scenario is around the committee emphasizes that its unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the april copom meeting inflation forecasts currently involve a higher level of risks around baseline inflation scenario the committee views the heightened uncertainty regarding the speed of the process of reforms and adjustments in the brazilian economy as the main risk this arises from both a higher probability of scenarios that may hinder this and the difficulty in assessing the effects of these scenarios on the determinants of these determinants include economic inflation estimates of the structural interest and prices of relevant financial there are other risks around the baseline the global despite currently involves a considerable level of uncertainty and might make disinflation more disinflation in food and industrial prices might produce effects on it might contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and inflation in other sectors of the economic activity points to stabilization in the short run and prospect of but the economy resumption might be more gradual and delayed than the discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic in light of available they all agreed that recent data confirm the scenario of stabilization and prospects of gradual economic if sustained over a long high levels of uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy can have detrimental effects on economic regarding the global the committee members pointed out the recent favorable bank of brazil of the global despite the uncertainties associated with possible changes in economic policy in the united with the evolution of commodity with risk appetite for emerging and with the outlook for the chinese they also highlighted that the brazilian economy nowadays shows greater capacity to respond to occasional negative developments in the global due to its more robust balance of payments and to the progress in the disinflationary process and in the anchoring of all committee members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable the members of the committee analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent considering the scenario that conditions on paths of the interest rate and exchange rate extracted from the focus projections for inflation remain below the target throughout projections reach a trough in the third quarter of the year and increase in the last months of the year to values still below part of this difference can be attributed to the primary effects of the favorable food price this scenario assumes an interest trajectory that reaches at the end of and in this the inflation trajectory reaches in members of the committee assessed the impacts of recent changes in regulated prices of fuel prices and the return of green flag on electricity on it is estimated that these adjustments should reduce june ipca inflation by approximately percentage all members concluded that these oscillations do not have relevant implications for the conduct of monetary the members of the committee discussed possible impacts of increased uncertainty on the prospective path of on the one they consider if sustained over a long high levels of uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy can have detrimental effects on economic and hence be on the other the impact of uncertainty on price setting and on estimates of the structural interest rate can have the opposite in the members of the committee emphasized at this the conditional projections of the copom involve greater they concluded that there is no direct and mechanical relationship between the increase in uncertainty and monetary and that the flexibility of the inflation targeting regime allows the committee to adjust policy to possible prospective the copom members assessed the extension of the monetary easing including its implications for the level of interest rates throughout the extension will depend on the evolution of economic on the other aforementioned risk on the projections and expectations of ipca inflation for and and also on the estimates for the structural interest rate of brazilian the committee judges that the recent increase in uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy hampers a more timely reduction of estimates of the structural interest and makes them more these estimates naturally involve uncertainty and may be reassessed by the committee over the committee members reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation with inflation forecasts at the target for and a little below target for and with the high level of economic the baseline scenario prescribes continuation of the monetary easing this understanding already considers the current risks around the baseline scenario and the estimates of the extension of the the committee understands for a given estimate of its the pace of monetary easing depends on the stage of the without necessarily reflecting changes in the baseline scenario or in the balance of all members of the copom agreed that the evolution of the economy since the april copom meeting is compatible with the reduction of the selic rate to percent the members of the committee discussed the next steps for monetary they assessed the pace of easing that would be recommended for the next meeting and whether early signaling of this possibility would be the analysis regarding the appropriate pace of easing involved considerations about inflation and activity the estimates of the extension of the cycle and its current and the risks surrounding the scenario and these including those associated with the prospects for reforms and adjustments in the regarding the convenience of on the one it was argued that the uncertainty bank of brazil the evolution of the baseline scenario inflationary or disinflationary than the current and the balance of risks did not recommend conjecturing on the possible pace to be adopted in the on the other the at this to provide guidance and elements to reduce the uncertainty the scope of regarding the future course of monetary policy was the copom members concluded that a moderate reduction in the pace of monetary easing should be appropriate at its next they also emphasized that this pace will continue to depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of on possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation forecasts and the committee members once again emphasized that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would allow the copom to focus on preventing effects of relative price adjustments that may occur over this applies to the favorable food supply shock and to the positive dynamics in prices of industrial but also to potential inflationary relative price the copom understands that it should seek to identify the primary effects of these relative price to which monetary policy should not monetary policy focus on possible effects of those which might contribute to changes in inflation projections and all members of the committee emphasized again that the approval and implementation of notably those of a fiscal and of adjustments in the brazilian including those related to credit policy and of are fundamental to the sustainability of to the full operation of monetary policy and to the reduction of its structural interest with widespread benefits for the committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvement of the business these efforts are fundamental for the stabilization and resumption of the economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by one percentage to percent per without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes to a greater is compatible with the monetary easing the copom emphasizes that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will among other on estimates of the structural interest rate of the brazilian the committee judges that the recent increase in the uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy hampers a more timely reduction of estimates of the structural interest and makes them more the committee will continue to reassess these estimates over in light of the basic scenario and current balance of the copom judges that a moderate reduction of the pace of monetary easing relative to the pace adopted today is likely to be appropriate at its next the pace of monetary easing will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation forecasts and the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes luiz edson otávio ribeiro reinaldo le sidnei corrêa and tiago couto monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index reached in percentage

volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some components of global accentuated by the effects of the slowdown of the chinese and of influenced by the reduction of investments in the production since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have fallen while metal commodities prices remained on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through december of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected change is in up from considered at the november copom among other this projection considers average adjustment in the urban bus tariffs of and change of in electricity maitained the ongoing tariff flags the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the trajectories of primary surplus set at of the gdp for and of primary surplus set at of the gdp for it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural result in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario considers the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the inflation projection compared to the value considered at the previous copom both for and for and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council for and slightly above the midpoint target for according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the inflation projection for also increased relative to the value considered at the november and remains above the inflation for the projection under the market scenario decreased relative to the considered in the last and stands slightly above the midpoint policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to the projected inflation by the bcb and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the committee considers that the external environment remains and that the uncertainties despite the occurrence of episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging the committee also identifies low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial for the the trend for global activity shows more moderation throughout the monetary policy relevant the recent prospects indicate modest activity recovery in the advanced while important emerging economies experience a transition in this of reduction in the activity it bears highlighting the growing concern regarding the chinese economy and its developments over the other still regarding international financial the copom highlights moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic gasoline the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy through productive such as the it should also be noted the increased uncertainties generated by low oil prices and their implications for sectoral companies and producing as well as for the financial markets in with risks to global financial the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and gdp growth rates have continued to pointing to domestic activity expansion pace this year lower than the previously this process has been especially intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of in investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of these and private consumption also shows contraction in line with data regarding employment and for the after a necessary period of which has been more intense and longer than as and confidence the activity expansion pace tends to the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and the investments tend to gain these coupled with other ones currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the depreciation of the brl contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economic regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of agriculture and livestock have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance in addition to the reduction on uncertainties surrounding the domestic and international the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint even if more slowly and with lower intensity than previously the committee observes that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary as well as in its impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a negative perception regarding the macroeconomic environment and have negatively impacted inflation concerning inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow the monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong consumer credit has so over the last there on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by actions that were the committee considers as opportune to continue to reinforce the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit in the as anticipated by previous the copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market has increased at a stronger with data confirming the acceleration in the process of distension in this there is still the prevalence of significant risk to the possibility of concession of high nominal with negative impacts over in spite of the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the estimates for the labor productivity the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers over these relative prices ajustments in the among other have made the balance of risks to inflation in this as anticipated in previous these price adjustments caused inflation to rise in requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts over the committee reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the second order effects stemming from given the assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the copom considers that uncertainties surrounding the balance of risks mainly on the speed of the fiscal recovery process and its and that the relative price realignment process has been slower and more intense than the previously in the uncertainties regarding the external scenario with highlights to the growing concern with the performance of the chinese economy and its developments and with the evolution of prices in the oil part of its members argued that it would be appropriate to the monetary in order to reduce the risks of of the inflation targeting regime objectives and reinforce the process of anchoring the inflation most of the copom members considered that the elevation of the domestic the external especially more justifies to keep on monitoring the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to then define the next steps in its monetary policy for these it is necessary to monitor the impact of the recent changes in the domestic and external environments on the balance of risks to combined with the adjustments already implemented in monetary can strengthen the inflation convergence scenario for the target in the decided to maintain the selic rate at without by six votes for the monetary policy action and two votes in favor of raising the selic rate by the following members of the committee voted for maintaining the selic rate at alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz edson feltrim and otávio ribeiro the following members of the committee voted for raising the selic rate to sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its the net exports show better either by increasing benefited by the depreciation of the or by the ongoing import substitution for the the combined effects of these the developments in the fiscal and quasi fiscal framework and in the assets in the dynamics of the regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by the in the committee emphasizes that there are uncertainties associated with the balance of mainly on the speed of the recovery process of fiscal results and on its and that the relative price realignment process has been slower and more intense than the the uncertainties regarding the behavior of the global economy in this the committee reaffirms that will take the necessary measures in order to ensure the compliance with the objectives of the targeting which means to circumscribe inflation to the limits established by the in and to make inflation converge to the in at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on march for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june ipca inflation changed from in september to in october and in as a inflation reached in the first eleven months of the highest change in the period since up from in the same period of trailing inflation changed from in september to in october and in november in november under this comparison the acceleration of consumer price inflation mirrors the behavior of both regulated prices and market market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through up from and in the twelve months through november both prices of tradable goods and goods reaching and in twelve respectively to and in november the price of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than the prices of increased in the twelve months through november up from in in september and in november an evolution that reflects the influence of domestic factors over the inflationary preliminary data for december point to consumer inflation index above that observed in in the reversal of the divergence trend of inflation from the targets which had been observed since the end of consolidated although the risk of an even higher deterioration of the inflationary dynamics has been the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb have reduced in the in the last the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices and the smoothed and nonsmoothed trimmed means core inflation measures decreased from and in to and in and to and in similarly to the headline the three core inflation measures accelerated remarkably in the first eleven months of the compared to the same period of with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core on a trailing the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices rose from in september to in october and reduced to in the smoothed and trimmed means core inflation slightly under this in the last the smoothed trimmed means core inflation changed from in september to in october and in whereas the trimmed means core inflation fell from in september to in october and in despite the reduction observed in all core inflation measures remain above the central value for the inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion whose average in the year through november is the highest recorded since showed substantial increase in and continues to point to an inflationary process relatively confirming the analysis present in previous copom the general price index inflation changed from in october to in on a trailing inflation decreased to in from in compared to in november in the twelve months through the increase reflected the behavior of its three main the consumer price increased in november while the wholesale price index totaled in november according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in november regarding the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of industrial the agricultural ipa changed in november while the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached in november in despite the cooling in wholesale industrial prices increased in the first eleven months of the up from in the same period of as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation the ibge released data for third quarter data still show robust growth both for accumulated results in the year up from in the previous and for results as against in the previous on the aggregate demand gross fixed capital formation continued to post strong growing by in the third quarter of household consumption grew by according to the same comparison influenced by the expansions of credit and real the of domestic absorption to gdp growth reached overweighing the negative impact stemming from the external on the aggregate supply it bears emphasizing the increase in industrial production followed by the agricultural sector and by the services sector on a regarding industrial it bears highlighting the civil construction industry benefited by public works and by the increase in credit to the gdp deflator at market prices increased from in the second quarter of the to in the third on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased in after growing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the expansion observed in industrial output retreated by in partially reflecting the programmed interruption in the petrochemical it bears noticing that general industrial output grew in the year through with respective increases of and in manufacturing and in mining on a industrial output expanded by in october one more working with respective growths of and in mining and manufacturing the data already released for the last months in to the interruption of the industrial production expansion mainly due to the deterioration of global economic prospects and its effects over the brazilian among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of capital goods decreased by in regarding the other use intermediate goods production decreased consumer goods production retreated by while the production of durable goods production reduced by in the capital goods production leads the with an followed by the elevation in durable consumer goods the recent slowdown in capital goods production has been reflecting the intensification of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business on its the cooling in the pace of expansion of durable goods production tighter credit conditions and the deterioration of consumer labor market continues to present favorable but with signs of accommodation in the generation of formal the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey retreated from in august and to in down from in october the october monthly result is the second lowest rate for the above only december last which stood at as a the average unemployment rate in the first ten months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate stood at the same rate recorded in at a historically low nominal average earnings increased in decelerating from the rate observed in but maintained a robust in average real earnings fell expansion relative to october in the first ten months of the average real earnings increased while the number of occupied workers grew as a real payroll increased expansion in in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in october to in september and in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in september to a fall in august and a increase in totaling increases of in the last twelve months and still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate loss of dynamism in the generation of formal employment in the with the creation of thousand jobs to thousand jobs in september this year and thousand jobs in october as a result of the probable reassessment of businessmen regarding the effects of worsening of global in the first ten months of the employment reached thousand above the same period of the previous an evidence of the robust demand for work in the formal employment grew by in seasonally and observed data point to a expansion in the last twelve the retail sector recorded the highest hiring rate in with the creation of thousand new followed by the services sector thousand new by the manufacturing industry thousand new and by civil construction thousand new on the other the agricultural due to seasonal factors related to the observed in the middlesouthern part of the was the only sector recording employment retreat of thousand according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after decreasing in and grew by in september and in through expanded retail sales moving average increased in seasonally after increasing by in august and in according to seasonally adjusted on a it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of material and followed by and part and and and domestic in the year through cumulative growth was more significant in material and and part and and personal and domestic in october and expanded retail sales data should evidence the effects of credit supply restrictions and the deterioration of consumer confidence over vehicle already captured by the data from the national federation of distribution of automotive vehicles fenabrave for these the steady growth of retail sales had been in the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be favored by fiscal as well as by employment and income but it will also be in case of by the changes in the access to credit and by the deterioration of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in slightly above the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing industry showed reaching in down from in without the seasonal the nuci stood above the level registered in october a record high for the as a the average rate in the first ten months of was above the level observed in the same period of the monthly nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas reached in standing below the level registered in the same month of the reduction in the nuci in november is also observed in the production of consumer goods and of intermediate goods for the capital goods the nuci showed stability compared to the level observed in november while for the production of civil construction inputs the nuci presented a the reduction on nuci calculated by fgv seems to be a result of a combination between investment projects maturity with softening on economic which should point to a start of less pressure over the idle capacity recent data about the absorption of capital goods still show a strong expansion compared to the same periods of the absorption of capital goods decreased in according to seasonally adjusted accumulating a expansion in in observed compared to and in according to the same comparison on the other the production of civil construction inputs showed stability at the margin in after decreasing by in accumulating a growth in growth in through although not evidences so far suggest to an ongoing process of reduction in the mismatches regarding the evolution of supply and domestic as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to register deceleration at the an already anticipated and which is in line with assessments present in previous inflation reports and copom in the last twelve months through november the trade surplus reached billion below november in the same exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and the reversal on the strengthening trend of the brl and the softening on the pace of expansion of domestic demand may contribute to a recover on the trade notwithstanding the reduction on price levels of exports acting on the opposite the decrease in trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through october equivalent to of foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress on international financial which originated in the us and but whose impact on emerging economies has become more the increased risk observed since after the bankruptcy of an important us led the authorities in the europe and oceania to intervene in an unprecedentedly way in their financial using wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money although systemic risk perception has showed pressures on the functioning of the interbank markets came back resulting from the nearness of the end of the year and the closing of the balance sheets of financial the international liquidity contraction has been contributing to a deleverage process by asset which in turn has been pressuring down the prices of financial in an environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital pressures on emerging currencies have been regarding the global macroeconomic at least in the short term the contraction trends prevail over the inflationary the dominant view still points to the at a modest of global economic activity in but data released in the last weeks indicate a more intense and generalized cooling of activity in mature economies and also in some emerging there are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in europe and parts of asia was predominantly due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities which could be on the other the problems in the financial system have been aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in credit which may reinforce the contraction in financial conditions as a the risk of intensification of the us in entered into recession at the end of and still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector with spillover effects on the labor whose together with the negative wealth effect associated to the fall in the prices of financial has affected the significantly contributing for depressing the prevailing interpretation is that the activity in europe and japan may continue to lose dynamism in the next in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating inflationary pressures have reduced on the other in emerging where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more the inflationary pressures have been more in this the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature whereas in emerging which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation in addition to the facts already the reaction seems to be more it is worth pointing particularly in mature the authorities are announcing a series of initiatives aimed at sustaining the economic particularly through fiscal which could contribute to a gradual economic oil prices remain highly but reduced considerably since the last copom future markets have in the prices of oil in the spot uncertainty concerning oil prices is remarkably as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the reaction to stimuli derived from previous changes on relative in addition to geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the great uncertainty inherent to the projections of oil the main scenario adopted by the which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in remains plausible but with the persistence of the current framework of the oil it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis that price reductions for oil can occur in it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline the reduction of international oil prices can affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation the prices of other commodities also showed important reductions since the last copom reacting both to the greater pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and to the continuity of the global financial markets of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following compared to the values considered in the october copom the projected adjustment for for gasoline prices was maintained at whereas for bottled gas price was revised to compared to the values considered in the october copom the projected adjustment for for fixed telephone price was revised to from while for electricity prices was maintained unchanged at the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual was altered to down from the considered in the october this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total november the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained unchanged at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic on the benchmark based on the swap estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and increased by the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca variation showed reduction to from ahead inflation expectations increased slightly to from considering the medians of expected monthly inflation expectations for increased to from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca inflation slightly decreased relative to the figure considered in the october copom but remained above the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also decreased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom but above the central target for the regarding both projections based on the benchmark scenario and on the market scenario showed a in relation to the figures forecast in the previous copom but are above the central target for that year and around this value policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continued quite robust until the third and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment performance in line with assessments present in previous copom the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets impose adjustments in the balance of payments despite the increase in brazilian economy external can increase the inflationary especially in the short in general the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant on the one more generalized deceleration of global economic activity in the upcoming quarters points to a cooling of both commodities prices and external therefore influencing negatively the local financial on the other the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk impacting the demand for brazilian and depreciating their the recent trajectory of price indices evidences the reduction of inflationary external in mature but also in emerging with important implications on domestic inflationary the committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario retreated when compared to the risk prevailing months but is still the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last monetary policy should act to avoid that the deterioration of inflation dynamics observed in become the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation trajectory could be the evidences of cooling of domestic and more of accommodation of pressures on the market of despite under may mitigate the through of wholesale prices pressures to consumer price the committee evaluates that the materialization of this and the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer prices depend critically on inflation which still remain in levels above the inflation targets path and continue to be carefully it is worth pointing according to recent data and the indicators available so the heating of domestic demand was still pressuring the prices of as in this the copom will act to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the maintenance of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance is essential to increase the probability that inflation in brazil evolve once again according to the targets path in for this higher probability to continue to it is necessary that inflation particularly the expected dynamics of aggregate supply and converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation this viewpoint is even more important in periods of higher the prospects for the evolution of economic activity deteriorated since the last copom in the effects of the international crisis on the domestic financial conditions indicate that the contribution of credit to support domestic demand may decline more intensively more persistently than the magnitude of what would happen exclusively by the monetary policy lagged the intensification of international crisis has caused a negative effect on and if this situation the strength of economic activity would increasingly depend on real payroll expansion and the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the copom highlights the important contribution of investment to expand productive it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities prices could contribute to restrain inflationary the copom evaluates particularly in the short the main risk to the inflationary dynamics derives from the trajectory of brazilian asset in a process of decreasing external if trends observed since the last copom meeting the pace of domestic demand expansion could not present important risks to prices dynamics which would contribute to limit the inflationary impact of balance of payments in this the pace of reduction of the mismatch between the growth of aggregate demand and supply of goods and relevant up to the third continues to be crucial to the assessment of different possibilities for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to higher risk to shorter planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects on income in the current there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability to the fact that inflation acceleration become reducing the efficacy of monetary on the other the shortage of financing conditions in the economy amplifies monetary policy contributing to promote inflation convergence to the targets aims to bring inflation rates in timely back to the midpoint target established by this which will have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of evidenced after the last of economic activity slowdown among others to industrial production some data on the labor market and industrial capacity utilization as well as confidence of consumers and as well as inflation expectations risks against the materialization of a benign inflation in which ipca would resume evolution in line with the targets are less influential but still prospective scenario evolution has started to reflect on inflation projections considered by the the copom also understands that the probability of persistence of mismatch between growth pace of aggregate supply and that continues to represent risk for inflation has under these monetary policy should be cautiously aiming to assure inflation convergence to the targets the copom believes that the consolidation of restrictive financial conditions for a longer period could significantly intensify monetary policy effects over demand throughout over under these the majority of the committee taking into account the balance of risks for economic and therefore for the inflation scenario in debated the possibility of a bps reduction of the selic the understanding that inflation central prospective path would still justify the maintenance of the selic rate unchanged has other copom members considered that the still remaining risks for inflationary resulting from the possible persistence of inflation increases in and consequences of the adjusting process of balance of payments are still predominantly conditioning the various alternatives for monetary in such having the majority of committee members discussed the possibility of reducing the selic rate at this in a macroeconomic environment surrounded by severe the copom unanimously at this to keep unchanged the selic rate at without the copom will closely monitor the prospective scenario evolution for inflation in order to timely define the next steps for its monetary policy under the the copom guides its decisions according to the projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prices dynamics and the balance of risks associated to their there are signs that domestic demand expansion which remained expanding at high rates in the third would be currently contributing less intensely for the economic activity in spite of persistence of stimulus factors such as income growth influencing the on the other the contribution of the external sector to a favorable inflationary in light of the strong depreciation in the prices of brazilian assets and the apparent reduction in the capacity to has become less in such the monetary policy should act so to bring inflation back to the targets path already in in order to avoid that the higher uncertainty detected in horizons disseminate to thus favoring a sustained recovery of economic if the risk profile changes in a way that implies shifts in the basic prospective scenario for inflation considered by the committee in this the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the at the end of the it was announced that the committee would reconvene on january for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom ipca reached in below market expectations and indicating inflation decrease taking into account figures in november and october market prices increased in down from in with increases of for tradable and for regulated prices increased down from in the diffusion index has remained above since reaching in november and a average in on a twelve months trailing ipca increased in down from in reflecting the increase on market prices and regulated prices in twelve month trailing basis and monthly ipca core inflation have shown generalized deceleration for the first time since july core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in november down from in totaling in the last twelve compared to in the previous the smoothed trimmed means core decreased to in november down from in reaching over the last twelve compared to in the previous the nonsmoothed trimmed means core decreased to in november down from in reaching over the last twelve compared to in the previous increased in november after a increase in reaching over the last twelve in comparison to in wholesale prices index went down influenced by the fourth decrease in a row of agricultural prices together with the decrease of industrial prices over the last twelve ipa increased down from in reaching in in comparison to in totaling over the last twelve incc increased in down from in reaching over the last twelve core increased in reaching over the last twelve among ipa the simultaneous fall of agricultural and industrial prices had not been registered since march decreased in comparison to a decrease in reaching over the last twelve was stable in comparison to the increase observed in the previous reaching over the last twelve by stages of ipa decreased in november in both final goods from in october to in november and intermediate goods from to raw material prices increased in comparison to in the previous in the last twelve ipa by stages of processing registered and weekly consumer price index variation accelerated from over the last week of november to over the first week of activity according to seasonally adjusted data from monthly survey expanded retail which include construction material and vehicles and parts and increased in all ten segments surveyed by the ibge with highlights for the growth of office material and and the growth on sales of parts and the latter partially resulting from the weak performance in the previous comparing equivalent periods of and expanded retail sales grew in september and in according to these two comparison there was generalized growth in all with highlights for office material and parts and other personal and domestic and furniture and home parts and pieces presented significant growth on a comparison after a weak performance in august growth over august according to são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the database consultations for credit sales decreased in november while consultations to usecheque system expanded according to the same comparison in the year through november these indicators increased and compared to the same period of regarding investment domestic production of capital goods decreased while production of construction typical inputs remained stable in seasonally within capital goods it bears highlighting the increase for transport softening the fall in all remaining production of capital goods increased in compared to october while production of construction typical inputs grew in the through october these indicators increased and compared to the same period of capital goods imports declined in according to the quantum indices of fundação centro de estudos do comércio exterior seasonally adjusted by the the october indicator expanded by higher than the through october and the growth results and sustaining the recent dynamism of capital goods cni indicators showed a relatively stable industrial activity pace in with a increase in both employment and installed capacity utilization and a reduction in worked according to seasonally adjusted data by the real revenues increased compared to with a growth in the quarter ended in seasonally in comparison to the same periods in real revenues expanded in october and in the year through while worked hours in industrial production increased and in the same comparison installed capacity utilization reached in above the level of in seasonally adjusted according to monthly industrial survey industrial production decreased in seasonally after a variation in the previous durable consumer goods a category of use more responsive to credit conditions and was the most with a partially reflecting the collective vacations in most automotive sector intermediate goods production decreased in the same comparison influenced by the falls of production of other chemical products and oil refine and ethanol production the latter partially caused by a technical interruption in one of the industrial production grew in october compared to october an increase significantly lower than the ones observed in previous eleven out of the activities surveyed showed expansion in october in the same comparison in the observed with highlights to the production of other transportation which increased it should also be noticed the variations of and registered

same comparison construction material had the smallest while capital goods registered the biggest leveling at in accordance with the fgv manufacturing industry installed capacity utilization reached in below november and in the seasonally adjusted below the previous in november only construction materials registered a positive change considering industrial pharmaceuticals and should be highlighted in the same comparison with and market according to the ministry of labor and employment thousand new formal jobs were created in october the worst outcome for the month since reflecting a significant deceleration in comparison to the previous in the year through thousand new jobs were with an increase in comparison to the same period of employment level increased by in seasonally adjusted expanding in all sectors but in the manufacturing in which it remained one should highlight the increase in the construction sector and the thousand new jobs in retail considering the observed there were increases terms and on a basis according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate stood at of the economically active population in remaining relatively stable in comparison to the registered in the two previous compared to october unemployment declined corresponding to the second smallest rate of all just below the registered in december in seasonally adjusted unemployment reached leveling with the relative stability of the unemployment rate in september and in the observed reflected the thousand

previous environment global economy and advanced countries face severe and there are clear evidences of recession in many of these forecasts for show contractions of both real gdp growth and inflation global financial crisis has affected both consumer and businessmen data from previous weeks have shown that businessmen confidence has suffered sharply deterioration in many this situation reflects particularly a generalized decrease in services and manufacturing pmis recently it is also evident in emerging where the levels of businessmen and consumer confidence have also fallen giving additional evidences that these countries will suffer the impact of the recession that hits the developed in the fourth quarter of global demand retraction installed capacity utilization lowered and unemployment in the numbers of november showed the most significant job cuts since the bringing the unemployment rate to reach the highest level in fifteen years in the other developed labor market conditions also show price behavior confirms the trend of disinflation started in the third quarter of this this pattern is more evident in economies that present lower level of activity and quicker falls in commodities particularly reflecting the sharp reduction in oil in the united this pattern is reinforced by the dollar in some emerging depreciation prevents further price reductions and limits the actions of their central in this the majority of central banks started or intensified monetary easing based not only on the broadening of the risks of but also on fears of in emerging

immediately after the last copom decision in the future yield curve experienced an upward parallel the interruption of the tightening monetary cycle and the expectation of a higher inflation in the near term were decisive factors for this from november the behavior of the yield curve changed and the interest rates began to show a falling mainly influenced by the release of both inflation data below market and economic data showing a retreat in the economic activity in the beginning of the fall in interest rates became more intense especially in the between october december and rates decreased by bps and and rates decreased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed twelvemonth ahead inflation decreased from on

affect promising results in vaccine trials tend to improve confidence and growth in the medium economic along with the communication of central banks of major suggests monetary stimuli will last resulting in a favorable environment for emerging turning to the brazilian recent indicators suggest the uneven recovery in economic activity as uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than especially for the period starting at the end of this concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer various measures of underlying inflation are in levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the latest inflation readings were higher than expected despite the predicted retraction of food price december inflation should remain with an collection of tuition fees and the transition to the highest level of the electricity rates flag despite the stronger inflationary the committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are but continues to monitor closely its in the core inflation the inflation projections in its baseline with the interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for and for and this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at rises to in and in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the ppp yields inflation projections around for for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation especially when this slack is concentrated in the service this risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary on the other an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravates the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the relative increase in the risks of these events implies an upward asymmetry to the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the international the committee evaluated that new information brings distinct impacts to different in the short the pandemic and the resulting increase in social distancing in some of the major economies should interrupt the recovery in in the medium positive vaccine test as well as monetary and fiscal should imply a stronger the perception of economic slack for an extended along with the communication of central banks of major creates an environment of liquidity and return of capital favorable to emerging the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they judged that the transfer programs from the government have allowed for a relatively strong rebound in durable goods consumption and recent data continue to reflect an uneven recovery in economic the unpredictability associated with the pandemic evolution and the necessary adjustment in government spending from on increases the uncertainty about the economic the committee judged that the risks associated with the pandemic evolution may imply a domestic scenario characterized by an even more gradual the copom members debated on the level of economic as with the committee believes that the pandemic continues to have heterogeneous effects on different economic the transfer programs from the government have reduced slack in the goods service especially those most directly affected by social distancing face a greater reduction in the evolution of these sectoral gaps will depend on the pandemic evolution and on the adjustment in public the committee discussed the implementation of monetary since its the copom uses forward according to it does not intend to reduce the monetary as long as specified conditions are the committee judged that those conditions continue to inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline remain below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary the current fiscal regime has not been and inflation expectations remain well the copom continued its considering not only the baseline scenario but also the balance of the committee judged at this the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks caused by fiscal risks is sufficient to compensate for the fact that inflation projections in its baseline scenario are below the target in the relevant the deemed as adequate the current level of monetary which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at and by the forward the committee again pondered over the interpretation of its forward guidance fiscal which conditions the of interest rates to the maintenance of the current fiscal the committee reaffirmed that changes in fiscal policy that affect public debt or compromise the fiscal would motivate a even if the spending ceiling in nominal terms is still this reassessment would follow the inflation target which is based on the analysis of prospective inflation and its balance of the committee assessed the next steps in monetary in particular the evolution of the forward guidance clause on expectations and inflation projections converging to the in the evaluation of the this convergence can occur for two an increase of expectations and projections for and the evolution of the with an increase of the relative weight of for which the expectations and projections at this close enough to the the committee decided to add to its communication although the forward guidance might be withdrawn this would not mechanically imply an increase in interest monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes and the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the committee deems as adequate the current unusually strong level of monetary which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at and by the forward guidance introduced in its the forward guidance stated that the copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are the committee judges that those conditions continue to in spite of having increased since the last in particular for inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline are still below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary the current fiscal regime has not been and inflation expectations remain well the copom judges since the adoption of the forward inflation expectations reverted their declining trend relative to the target for the relevant over the next the should become less relevant than the for which projections and expected inflation are around the a scenario of inflation expectations converging to the target suggests that the conditions for maintaining the forward guidance may soon no longer which does not mechanically imply interest rate since economic conditions still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary in case the forward guidance ceases to monetary policy will follow the inflation target based on the analysis of prospective inflation and its balance of the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro damaso and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the environment became less some central banks in advanced economies expressed more clearly the need for caution given the increased persistence of turning the environment more challenging for emerging in the real state sector situation in the possibility of a winter and the emergence of the omicron variant add uncertainty about the pace of recovery in advanced these events produced falls in some important commodity but it is still too early to predict the extent of this in relation to the brazilian economic the release of the third quarter gdp figures revealed a slightly although the activities most affected by the pandemic continued on a robust recovery higher frequency indicators point to reduced economic widespread among various in september and possibly in the already available confidence indexes for the initial months of the current quarter show the committee revised downward its expectations for activity in the short for on the one the rise in risk premia and the more intense tightening of financial conditions act stifling the economic on the other hand copom considers that economic growth tends to benefit from the performance of agriculture and livestock and from the remaining effects of the normalization process of the economy particularly in the services sector and in the labor market as the health crisis consumer inflation remains with increases spread among several and has proven to be more persistent than the increase of industrial prices has not slowed down and should persist in the short whereas services inflation accelerated due to the gradual normalization in the as recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile and on the items associated with core the significant drop in international energy commodity which have had substantial has limited the upward revision of the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchasing power parity stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that rises to in and to in ending the year at and drops to during in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the energy flag is in december and is assumed to be level in december and in december risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a inflation in the baseline on the other further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the risk despite the more positive public accounts the committee assesses that doubts regarding the fiscal framework increase the risk of deanchoring inflation keeping the upward asymmetry in the balance of this implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the baseline discussion about the conduct of monetary uncertainties regarding the future of the current fiscal framework have resulted in increased risk premia and raised the risk of deanchoring inflation this implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest the committee reiterates that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic weaknesses in the structural reform effort and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and the exchange rate evolving according to the purchasing power the inflation projections are above the target for and around the target for as for the balance of the committee pondered that the risk of a deanchoring of derived from developments in the fiscal points to an upward bias for the projections of its baseline considering this bias due to asymmetric copom evaluated that its projections are above the target for both and given this copom concluded that the monetary tightening process should be more restrictive than that used in the baseline scenario throughout the relevant copom assessed the appropriate pace of interest rate for it analyzed its inflation projections using simulations with monetary policy paths with different terminal under several alternative the committee also compared scenarios with adjustments greater than with scenarios in which the interest rate remains high for a longer period than that implied in the baseline based on these copom members discussed the most appropriate the committee concluded that adjustments of at this moment are adequate to throughout the process of monetary a level restrictive enough not only to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant horizon but also to consolidate the anchoring of monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to the targets over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes and without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given the increase in its inflation projections and in the risk of deanchoring it is appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening significantly into the restrictive the committee will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets for the next the committee foresees another adjustment of the same the copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda rumenos manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation increased to in november up from in as a in the year through november inflation reached decreasing relative to the same period of the previous in the last twelve inflation increased to in november up from in october in december and in november remaining near the the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the first eleven months of the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated price inflation considering market both prices of tradable and goods cooled on a twelvemonth trailing showed reaching and in down from and in december and in november according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of slightly increased to in november up from in december in november preliminary data for december point to consumer inflation below the level observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary acceleration cycle observed last year has been gradually overcome by a process led by the behavior of market specially while regulated price and services inflation continue to show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased between october and the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices changed from in october to in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures also recording and in up from and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced to in november to in november the general price index inflation changed from in october to in on a trailing the inflation remained at in november november the slowdown of the has basically reflected the behavior of all its three its main the wholesale price index reached in the last twelve months through november in november on its the consumer price increased through november in november and the civil construction national index increased in november regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached in november while wholesale industrial prices reached in november as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in august and accelerated to in september and still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output increased by in september and in the tenth consecutive month of on a industrial output retreated by in in september and in the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output and its suggests that production reached its trough in and has been followed by gradual industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international by business and as well as by the developments of domestic financial supported by traditional sources of besides the recovery of capital markets and the performance of financial public among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in it bears highlighting the durable consumer goods strongly influenced by the automotive sector and by capital both of them with a growth rate of regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased whilst and consumer goods production increased the at the in the dynamism of industrial led by production of durable although more widespread than to a great tax exemption measures and also some easing in credit the future behavior of industrial production which should not be uniform over will depend on these as well as on the evolution of consumer and businessmen counterbalancing the still emerging recovery of external labor market has behaved more with resilient aspects prevailing over signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey changed from in august to in september and to in october in october according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate remained unchanged at the same level reached in average real earnings increased by in in on its retreated by in according to the same comparison as a real payroll reached over october continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that the generation of formal employment has continued to record significant in thousand jobs were created thousand in representing the best result in the series for the the manufacturing industry showed positive balance of thousand the seventh consecutive month of expansion and the best result of the series for the the commerce sector continued the recovery trajectory initiated in with the positive result of thousand the best result for the the civil construction the most dynamic one with a cumulative growth in and the services sector continued hiring workers this and thousand also in the services the creation of jobs in october was the best result for the month in the the agricultural and livestock on its lost thousand following the seasonal according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in august and in on a the indicator increased by in growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after recording in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of parts and and material and the negative key drivers were and and medical in the cumulative growth was more significant in material and and and medical since the beginning of the expanded retail sales data have evidenced mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to the improvement in the access to credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the inflation but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit influenced by the lagged effects of monetary policy and by the evolution of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by reached in november in the previous month and at the level observed in getting closer to the average observed in the last five the series seasonally adjusted by cni changed from to between september and considering the monthly series without seasonal the fgv calculated nuci reached in below the level registered in the same month of this small reduction in the nuci in according to the is also observed in the production of intermediate goods while there is stability in construction inputs and an increase of in consumer goods the expansion more intense of idleness is restricted to capital goods sector the reduction on the according to the same comparison results from a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic but more recent data suggest that idle margin has been data regarding the absorption of capital goods show retraction compared to the same periods of and expressive expansion at the the absorption of capital goods data increased in october a increase in a increase in the quarter ended in compared to the quarter ended in according to seasonally adjusted and a decrease of in according to observed on its the production of construction inputs increased by at the margin in october increase in the after a increase in accumulating a fall in the in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have been increasing the last showing a reduction in the idle margin of the accompanied by the resume of as stressed in previous copom the inflation is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance reduced at the reaching a surplus of billion in and decreasing to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the recent narrowing of trade the reduction in remittances of profits and on its has contributed to limit the trailing current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress reduction in international financial despite not in a monotonic the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in mature using a wide range of have continued to moderate the perception of systemic in an environment of strong liquidity under these conditions the signs of reduction in risk aversion as evidenced by the behavior of international equity although this process remains subject to the trend of reduction of risk aversion and of the scarcity of capital as well as some concern among investors about the fiscal situation in the continued to encourage the recovery of both from emerging and mature against the us yet in a more modest and heterogeneous terms in relation to the movement observed in previous regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary pressures in but recovery of economic activity seems to have been the current predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in followed by recovery in the consensual projections point to a retraction of activity in the europe and japan which would not be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences of gradual recovery in the economic but still subject to particularly due to the weakness in the labor market and economic activity in on the other the risks that the problems of the international financial system may be aggravated by the cyclical deterioration of the credit which could contain the distension of financial and difficulty the consolidation of but seem to be the minimal points of inflation in mature economies seem to have been despite the on a trailing of the disinflation process in several emerging in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy in a significant number of monetary policy seems to have begun a phase of whereas the increase in public sector debt imposes limits on the scope of any additional fiscal oil spot prices have not shown a clear trend since the last copom future markets did not show a consistent trend as uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in the context of global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact in the evolution of food such as soybeans and increased since the last copom as well as metallic industrial such as aluminum and of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following the projected adjustments for gasoline prices for increased from in the october increased to while the projection for bottled gas prices rose from to in the same for there are no projected changes for gasoline and bottle gas regarding the projected adjustment for fixed telephone and electricity prices for the former increased to from percentage considered in the october while the latter moved from to the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity prices for are and the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was kept unchanged at for the projection is kept at as considered in the october this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total november the projection for regulated prices inflation for is such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and in in both cases adjusted by the possibility of reduction by up to and due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program it is considered that the primary surplus in would return without adjusts to the level of of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca slightly moving from to for the median of inflation expectations increased to up from whereas it its for the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast in this scenario the projection for inflation increased relative to the figure considered in the october copom and lies around the target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for increased as standing around the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection increased relative to the figure considered in the october but remains close to the midpoint whereas the projection under the market scenario remains policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic the risk aversion and the liquidity conditions prevailing in international markets continue to show a normalization trend at the in since the last copom signs of global risk aversion reduction have continued to despite still subject to with impacts over both brazilian asset as well as over selected which had also been influencing domestic financial it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences external inflationary pressures the impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path continues to up to predominantly on its the possible consolidation of the world economy recovery might although in a heterogeneous the global inflationary on the top of it should be added the uncertainty generated by the effects of the unprecedented liquidity expansion on mature over the price behavior of both assets and the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized pressures impose risks to the inflationary trajectory remains the moderation of domestic demand pressures over the market of at least in the short should contribute to contain the risk of of possible upward pressures over consumer prices stemming from wholesale prices returned to deflation in recent the committee understands that the materialization of such as well as the generalization of initially localized over the consumer still depends critically on economic inflation inflation expectations for and remain in line with the targets path and continue to be closely it is worth noticing that the domestic demand behavior tends to exert contained pressure over nontradable such as over the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity have continued to improve since the last copom as evidenced by data on commerce industry and labor signs of credit recovery continue to in particular regarding loans to also for consumer and businessmen confidence there are consistent signs of under such the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll on the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and on incremental governmental which will occur in the upcoming it should also benefit from the easing of financial favored by the policy of official among other in the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous copom meetings minutes that the contractionist effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which the monetary policy could become but would not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have concentrated impacts in the copom understands that the risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario in the short from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and certain regulated items since the beginning of as well as from a possible hike in commodities in the medium the risk stems from cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing and from the fiscal stimulus over the evolution of domestic taking into account the dynamics of consumption and in a context of recovery of production factors the balance of such influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk for both private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that that the convergence of inflation towards the target path observed in continues to be registered in and such which results have been evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the idleness margin of the evidenced by indicators of capacity utilization in industry and of the labor and the behavior of inflation expectations for relevant the materialization of a benign inflation in which the ipca would continue to evolve according to the target has remained by the such evolution of the scenario continues to be reflected on the inflation projections considered by the under such in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflationary under a macroeconomic scenario with significant the evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious aiming to assure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets the committee understands that the accommodation of motivated by the tightening of financial conditions and by deterioration of the as well as by the global economic activity has been although significant idleness margin of production factors still which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic the copom also highlights that there are uncertainties around such basic which should be clarified over the upcoming with both positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity under such scenario of gradual which has been corroborated by current available inflationary pressures should remain on the other the committee notices that the significant monetary policy implemented between january and will have cumulative effects over the which will be evidenced with a time the committee understands that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the stimuli introduced into the whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over in a context of a gradual and consistent recovery of production factors the copom also understands that a more cautious stance will contribute to mitigate the risk of abrupt reversals of monetary policy in the future to the consistent recovery of the economy over the upcoming the copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates to be closely monitored over regarding the inflation prospects compared to the targets the copom has unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without taking into on the one the monetary policy easing implemented since january on the other the idleness margin of production among other the committee evaluates that such level of basic interest rate is now consistent with a benign inflationary contributing to assure the maintenance of inflation in line with the targets path over the relevant horizon for the recovery of economic under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a short period of domestic demand started to show signs of due to the stimulus factors such as income it bears noticing evidencing the credibility achieved by the copom on the implementation of the inflation expectations for and remain in line with the targets it is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial on its important and fiscal stimuli were introduced into the economy over the last quarters and should contribute to the activity recovery to the reduction of the idleness margin of production those stimuli effects should be closely monitored over time and are important in the context where future monetary policy which should ensure the materialization of the convergence of inflation to targets path over relevant will be at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on january for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom ipca inflation reached in up from in but showing decrease from the variation of for november market prices increased in compared to in as a result of increases of on tradable items and on while regulated prices increased in down from in the diffusion index reached in averaging in on a trailing the ipca variation was in up from in

in its three but reflecting in particular the behavior of which reached in the changed according to the same comparison while the incc increased the deceleration of the in twelve months stems both

the global economy strengthened with the release of positive data for gdp growth in the us and the euro after four consecutive negative results in the and five in the euro at the same the japanese economy registered the second consecutive quarter of growth in the third accelerating from the expansion of the previous the resumption of growth in the two largest economies has supported the recovery of international trade and economic activity in other regions of the among the emerging china and india followed with acceleration on annual growth while mexico and south korea registered high quarterly growth due to the progressive reduction of the basis the rise in commodity particularly which has been taking place since the beginning of the has changed the behavior of the consumer prices indices in the the euro area and the deflationary process lost importance with the annual fluctuations in the cpi reaching and in the united kingdom and in some emerging economies such as south hungary and the disinflationary process also began to in the us and the euro the persistence of low rates of utilization of accompanied by stability in inflation should contribute to avoid inflationary pressures in the short and medium in this except for the persistent japanese which registered annual growth of in and the economy of the united where high prices back to worry the the overall inflation scenario is still considered despite the announcement of the debt restructuring of the dubai world sovereign wealth which more to an increased risk in international financial markets showed relative stability during the in this most central banks kept unchanged their basic interest in some local conditions imposed different behavior to the monetary in israel and where the economy has given clear signs of central banks decreased the stance of their accommodative monetary in the opposite in the united japan and central banks increased the local monetary respectively through increasing the value of direct purchases of by additional injection of liquidity and through the continuous reduction of basic interest trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus

the same comparison it bears in the purchases of billion by the monetary market and open market operations after the october copom the yield curve slope increased for all the release of data for the economic activity and labor and current inflation higher than expectations contributed to this between october and december and rates increased by bps and whereas and rates increased by bps and real interest measured by the differential between the forward interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on october to on december in its open market the bcb carried between october and december long fixed rate repo borrowing billion for a the average daily balance of the and operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of

the end of operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily the average daily balance of these borrowing operations reached billion between october and december up from billion between september and october considering the daily balance of operations in the most recent there was a reduction of the purchase commitments of the total stock reached billion on december down from billion on october the main determinant factors of the liquidity decrease in the period were the net issuance of securities by the national treasury and the net revenues of the federal between october and december the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached being billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in april and october combined with the purchase of ltns maturing in january totaling it also conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in september and september combined with the purchase of lfts maturing in december totaling the sales of settled in other national treasury securities maturing in and totaled the treasury also conducted purchase auctions of and reaching billion and respectively the set of indicators released recently suggests economic including in the last quarter of and that the economic recovery should be delayed even and be more gradual than previously the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment the global outlook remains quite this uncertainty among other from possible changes in the course of economic policy in the united and from the resumption of the process of normalization of monetary conditions by the the end of the benign environment for emerging economies has had a limited impact so returning to the domestic recent inflation figures came in more favorably than with signs of more widespread there is evidence that the more widespread disinflation process has reached ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary as a inflation for ended at well below expectations held a few months and within the tolerance limits set for the inflation target for last inflation expectations collected by the focus survey for have declined to around and expectations for and more distant horizons remained anchored at around the path of regulated which enters the conditional forecasts in the inflation scenarios produced by the assumes increases of in and in the reference scenario among other that the interest rate and exchange rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast horizon per annum and the market scenario considers the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the focus in this scenario assumes exchange rates of and at the end of and unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the previous inflation report and interest rates of and at the end of the same the conditional inflation forecasts retreated relative to those in the latest inflation which were based on information available until december among other changes in forecasts were influenced by inflation and economic activity data released since in the reference forecasts for and are around and the market scenario for and shows inflation around and the incorporation of the latest data on economic activity into the information set contributed significantly to the decline in conditional inflation risks around baseline inflation scenario inflation behavior has been more which may signal lower inflation the process of disinflation of some ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy requires continuous the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity tend to produce disinflation that can be more intense than the one reflected in inflation expectations measured by the focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the the more favorable inflation dynamics in the recent period show signs of more widespread economic activity and the prospect of a further delayed and more gradual recovery tend to reinforce this the steps toward approval of fiscal reforms have been positive so which suggests greater timeliness and higher probability of on the other the process is lengthy and carries the end of the benign period for emerging economies might produce effects that make disinflation more federal open market extended consumer price bank of brazil discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic in light of the most recent they all agreed that the evidence points to economic activity in the last in face of challenges for the resumption of economic this contributed to consolidate the assessment that the recovery of the economy may be further and be more gradual than previously regarding the global the committee members pointed out the uncertainties associated with possible changes in economic policy in the united states and also with the end of the benign period that prevailed during most of last considering that the process of normalization of monetary conditions in that country these uncertainties have fueled an increase in interest rates in major developed with impact on emerging financing the effects on asset prices of the end of the benign environment for emerging economies have been limited so far in particular for which have been experiencing improvements in their terms of this context reinforces the assessment of committee that there is no mechanical relationship between the global outlook and monetary all members of the committee agreed that the conditions set out at the november copom meeting for speeding up the pace of monetary easing were inflation evolved favorably in the recent coming below with the evidence of resumption of the disinflation at the of components that are most sensitive to the economic cycle and monetary the broad set of core measures of inflation followed by the copom points to inflation at levels compatible with the target of for and available evidence reinforces the reading that expectations remain these factors contribute to greater confidence in the projections that the disinflation process towards the target will the economy has been operating at a weaker pace relative to what was expected a few months and recent releases continued to point to economic activity at the even after the latest revisions for the end of the steps in the process of consideration of additional fiscal reforms and other necessary adjustments in the economy remain copom members also agreed with anchored inflation expectations and inflation at the target for and marginally below the target for the evolution of economic activity recommends frontloading the monetary policy easing this strategy contributes to the stabilization process and subsequent resumption of economic without deviating from the goals of bringing inflation to the target in and the committee then moved to the assessment of options for the frontloading of the monetary easing the copom entertained reducing the selic rate to percent per year and signaling a larger cut at the next if conditions in favor of this option weighted the benefit of accumulating more evidence of the consolidation of baseline another benefit would be a greater smoothing of the trajectory of the monetary policy which increases its predictability in the long the committee assessed that conditions for reducing the policy rate to at the current meeting were already present due to the more widespread disinflation and economic in an environment with anchored inflation this decision would already contribute to the stabilization process and later resumption of economic without requiring a departure from the objective of bringing inflation to the target in and the committee members also judged that this decision was compatible with its which favors spelling out economic conditionalities for the evolution of monetary as this can better transmit the economic rationality that guides the in the the evolution of the outlook for inflation and the evidence on the evolution of economic activity gathered since the november copom meeting and the december inflation report reference date for the conditional inflation projections was december allow for a reduction in the interest rate at a higher pace than the one discussed by the committee at its november the conditional nature of communication on the conduct of monetary policy allows economic agents to update their expectations based on such the committee members once again emphasized that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would enable the copom to focus on preventing effects of relative price adjustments that may occur over all committee members reiterated that the approval of the constitutional amendment that limits the real expansion of public expenses is an bank of brazil contribution to the brazilian they also emphasized the importance of other fiscal reforms for the continuation of the ongoing disinflationary process and for the prospects of maintaining inflation around with benefits for the committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvement of the business these efforts are fundamental for the stabilization and resumption of the economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the current balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to percent per without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with a gradually increasing is compatible with an intensification of the ongoing monetary easing the copom entertained reducing the selic rate to percent per year and signaling a larger cut at the next in face of the environment with anchored inflation the committee judges that the current scenario with more widespread disinflation and economic activity makes it already appropriate to frontload the monetary easing and allows the new pace of the extension of the cycle and possible revisions of the pace of easing will continue to depend on inflation forecasts and and on the evolution of the aforementioned risk the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes luiz edson otávio ribeiro reinaldo le sidnei corrêa marques and tiago couto ipca after moving from in march to in reduced to in as a inflation accumulated in the first five months of reached above the level registered in the same period of the previous the rise in inflation in mirrors the behavior of market which increased by in the year through focusing on market both prices of tradable goods and goods accelerated in the first five months of the reaching and up from and in the same period of on its regulated prices increased by in the first five months of the compared to in the same period of the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of reached until may and in twelve in information available suggests continued deterioration of inflation dynamics at the although at a slower the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed convergent behavior between april and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in april to in as well as the double weight core inflation to and core inflation by exclusion to in the year through the core inflation by exclusion increased by while smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation measures increased and these changes and above the rates prevailing in the same period in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december for the core inflation by smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation to and in it is important highlighting that all core inflation on a are above the midpoint of inflation it bears emphasizing despite the ipca diffusion index remained unchanged compared to april its level continues to suggest dissemination in the inflation acceleration process in the same month of the general price index inflation increased from in april to in in the year through the inflation reached in the same period of under this comparison the acceleration of the reflected the behavior of its three the wholesale price index increased in the year through may in the same period of on its the consumer price index brazil increased in the same period in still according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in the inflation under this comparison derived both from the behavior of agricultural and industrial while the industrial ipa increased in the same period of the elevation of wholesale agricultural prices reached in as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand as well as on price expectations for the future inflation the ibge and geography brazilian released information about the data showed expansion in which increased in the first and a increase according to seasonally adjusted on the aggregate demand household consumption and public administration consumption and gross fixed capital formation increased and imports grew according to the same comparison whereas exports increased the positive contribution of domestic absorption to the gdp growth totaled overweighting the negative contribution of the external on the aggregate supply still according to the same comparison the services sector presented a positive growing by while industry grew by and on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in march and in still considering the seasonally adjusted on a after expanding by in march from an increase of pp in the observed industrial output decreased by in on a industrial output increased by in compared to in on a trailing the industrial production growth expanded in april after consecutive declines since february despite the decrease on a the behavior of ibge industrial output and its shows that industrial production returning to levels of at a pace that continues to be influenced by the international by business and households as well as by domestic financial this process is supported not only by traditional sources of but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in april it bears highlighting the expansions of in capital goods and in durable consumer goods goods production increased on its consumer goods production decreased contributing to the decline in the consumer goods production in the after rising and in february and considering the quarterly all categories showed capital durable consumer and semidurable consumer and intermediate it bears highlighting that capital goods productions expanded by in the year through the most remarkable expansion among the use demonstrating the consistent recovery of the domestic the recovery in industrial production dynamism was initially led by the production of durable but it has become even more widespread than reflecting tax exemption in advanced process of as well as the easing in financial conditions and the income the future behavior of industrial which should not be uniform over will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen which should continue to be sources of to which shall be added the gradual recovery of external labor market continues to show vigor in clear process of expansion in the economic the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey decreased from in march to in lower than that observed in the same month of last according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached in down from in the previous average real earnings were stable in after increasing by in on its increased by in march and in as a real payroll expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that formal employment has continued to in thousand jobs were created in april and thousand in the year through in the latter the expansion of the period was a record high for the historical begun in the manufacturing services and civil construction registered the largest balances accumulated since the most dynamic sector continues to be civil where employment recorded a increase in the first four months of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after increasing by in on a the indicator increased in the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after reaching in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of parts and and material and expanded retail sales data have been evidencing mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable in response to the improvement in the access to income expansion and temporary sector incentives granted by the the retail sector continues to register positive performance and indicates that the pace of domestic demand growth remains but show some signs of for the next it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by fiscal by real payroll by the recovery in the access to credit and by the evolution of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in above the level registered in the same month of according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci reached in april from in according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reached in may in the previous the first decline since february among the four use the nuci in construction material versus in the previous and in intermediate goods industry versus in the previous increased on a with the former reaching a new historical record for the while the latter is slightly above the historical on its the industries of consumer goods versus in the previous and capital goods versus in the previous have shown little reduction compared to the previous the trend of reduction in the idle capacity is the result of economic activity not totally offset by the maturity of investment data regarding the absorption of capital goods show recovery compared to the same periods of despite the decline of in april compared to the previous the absorption of capital increased and in the year through on its the production of construction inputs recorded virtual stability at the margin in after a strong increase of in according to observed it increased in accumulating growth in twelve in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have recorded upward trajectory in the last showing reduction in any remaining idle margin of the despite the recovery of as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance retreated at the reaching a billion surplus in billion lower than the obtained in the same period last this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of the trade the increase in remittances of profits and dividends contributed to elevate the trailing current account which reached billion in equivalent to of up from billion in on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by deterioration in the process of normalization of activity in international financial following the intensification of the effects of fiscal crisis in many european with impact on the volatility of asset the perception of systemic risk fueled by the view that there would be interdependence between a possible fiscal consolidation in economies that are facing difficulties in this area and the balance sheets of financial until the possibility of realization of a stress scenario seems there was some moderation in demand for risky assets in international financial the global economy continues to show recovery in whose intensity might accelerate in in a scenario in which the economies of the europe and japan recover some but with considerable discrepancy between the and with the recovery process being led by emerging the economy shows signs of as can be for at the end of the process of rebuilding of with positive impact on industrial activity and retail although these indicators show some the levels of consumer confidence also although remaining at levels well below those prevailing before the crisis of the labor market begins to show signs of on its the economic activity in japan continues to suggest a slow led by in the euro fiscal concerns turn the recovery more the household consumption shows no consistent signs of and the economic recovery tends to be slower and in since the last copom the uncertainty regarding the sustainability and pace of consumption expansion in mature economies mainly in in a scenario where economic policy stimuli are replaced by contractionary and prospects for credit expansion are on the other in many emerging economic activity remains in a path of in some evidence of heat in the markets of production factors and in there is already concern about the dynamics of inflation in major emerging in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy monetary policy continues unchanged in several and in those economies that were less impacted by the international which had recovered more quickly and the adoption of more restrictive monetary policy has since the last copom oil prices showed some both in spot and future despite the high in the uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in a context of asymmetric global economic on major uncertainties about the recovery of the european on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices might affect domestic prices both through production such as the and through the potential effect over inflation to reduce liquidity in china may have an effect on commodity it bears emphasizing that agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact on the evolution of food have presented some reduction since the previous copom on the other iron an important input in the production chain of the industrial has shown significant increase in although there was a reduction in market players expect another price change in the of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone was kept at for while the projections for electricity prices adjustments rose to for up from considered in the april the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was maintained at the same projection considered at the april according to the benchmark this set of according to data released by accounted for of the total may the projection for regulated prices inflation for was maintained at on the benchmark such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be reduced by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refers to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations remained at the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the april copom and continues to be significantly above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also standing significantly above the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection decreased relative to the figure considered at the april copom but remains significantly above the inflation midpoint under the market the projection and is positioned above the midpoint policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in international risk aversion has increased since the last copom largely due to concerns about the sovereign debt of european although liquidity in international markets the prospects for external funding for the brazilian economy remain in line with greater risk aversion and more scarce the prices of some selected commodities and brazilian assets on another the trajectory of price indices evidences inflationary pressures in relevant in this the influence of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path is more although uncertainty persists about the behavior of asset prices and commodities in the context of the worsening international financial the copom assesses that this scenario can depending on the dynamics that derives from the market distrust regarding the solvency of some european on the other recognizes that this is not the baseline scenario regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook the copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom believes that the indicators released since the last meeting reinforce the perception about the existence of pressures over the market of increasing the probability that initially localized inflationary episodes pose risks to the inflation in this the risk of of upward costs pressures to wholesale price and from these to consumer price increases as the committee states that the materialization of these as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer continues to depend critically on the economic expectations for inflation and on the idleness degree of the among other these and other variables are part of the information set that is taken into account in the generation of inflation forecasts by the which constitute a key element in the assessment on the prospective inflation it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand has exerted some pressure over the prices of such as considering the prospects for the evolution of the main factors sustaining aggregate may in any the committee reaffirms the commitment that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom considers important to once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current and past inflation the prospective suffered some deterioration earlier this a dynamic that has continued since the last in spite of seasonal and occasional contributions to the rise in consumer prices as well as of price movements of certain domestic prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain as evidenced by data on manufacturing capacity utilization and the labor this assessment is also supported by signs of continued expansion of credit both for individuals and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high and by income the dynamism of domestic activity should also be among other by fiscal the policies of official banks to a lesser the pace of recovery in global considering the brazilian new cycle of these considerations become even more relevant when one takes into account that there are lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects over the activity level and the copom believes that the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem mainly from the domestic for those resulting from the expansion of domestic demand in the context of virtual exhaustion of the idleness margin in the use of production evidences of narrowing of the market factors are the acceleration of real wage gains in the recent past in some segments and higher producer price these developments may exacerbate an outlook that already evidences the presence of mismatch between the growth of domestic absorption and capacity of supply international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the committee believes that the economy is in a new expansion and this assessment is corroborated by data released since its last although uncertainty about the pace of this process which should be resolved over time still signs of overheat in the economy are for in core inflation in the behavior of inflation in the evidence of workers shortage and in the rising inputs in during this the inflation projections considered by the committee showed slight deterioration in the prospective the copom believes that this deterioration should be contained the signs of persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand expansion and aggregate tend to increase the risk for inflation must be in such the monetary policy stance should be on the one because it contributes to the convergence between the pace of demand expansion and supply on the other because it prevents that originally localized price pressures determine a persistent deterioration of the inflation prospective in despite the withdrawal of substantial share of the stimuli introduced during the recent international financial since the last meeting the risks for the achievement of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation targets remained on the other it is worth noting that in that same external developments have introduced a certain amount of caution in the analysis of the prospective the prevailing opinion among the committee members was that monetary policy should be adjusted incisively in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer under these continuing the adjustment process of monetary conditions to the prospective scenario of the in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the targets the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without under the the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the domestic demand appears largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and should contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion for the reduction of any residual idleness margin of productive the effects of these counter the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial and a possible deepening of the fiscal crisis that several european countries these elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets in it bears noticing that there was consensus among the committee members about the need to adapt the pace of adjustment of the basic interest rate to the developments in the prospective inflation as well as to the corresponding balance of in order to limit the impacts caused by the behavior of current inflation over the underlying prices at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on july for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in

restore financial stability in europe was not sufficient to calm market risk aversion has rates of stock exchanges in several countries retreated and the euro reached the lowest value against the us dollar in the last four in the movement of investment in assets perceived as less risky reduced the government securities yields of major mature available data suggest the continuing process of global economic driven primarily by the asia and latin in an environment of high among the the us and japan reported annualized quarterly growth rates and in the while the euro area grew in the the most recent indicators for retail industrial production and the net creation of jobs remained pointing to a positive in the euro domestic consumption remains and the expansion of economic activity over the first quarter was due to the positive contribution of in although the purchasing managers index for manufacturing activity in may has indicated the main economic indicators continue to point the maintenance of high economic growth in the inflation remains at modest levels in the us and in the euro area the consumer price index annual changes in april reached in the us and in the euro in the cpi remains in deflation for fifteen having in annual change of in this the central banks of retained the accommodative monetary policies the persistence of high unemployment and idle production factors in conjunction with anchored inflation expectations should help to maintain this accommodative stance for a longer period of time than had been among expansionary emerging the price pressures have already the cpi annual changes recorded in april and in mexico and like india and malaysia and brazil and the monetary authorities in emerging economies should even in the stance of their monetary trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in a monthly record high since june accumulating billion in the year through it should be noted that this lower than that reported in the same period of last seems consistent with the process of recovery of strong activity observed in the brazilian in the exports totaled and growing by and in the year through exports and imports and relative to the same period of based both on the liquidity concept and on the cash international reserves reached billion in recording respectively billion and growths the two concepts were equal due to the full payment of borrowing operations in foreign currencies in in through the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic market and open market operations since the april copom the slope of the domestic yield curve has decreased throughout its the rates increased influenced by the disclosure of activity data suggesting consistent recovery of the brazilian economy and expectations of inflation above the targeted the resume of crisis in europe and greater pessimism about the recovery of the global were key drivers in the decline of long between april and june and rates increased by and the and rates decreased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on april to on june in its open market the bcb carried between april and june repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in

balance of the total stock of repurchase agreement of the central bank decreased from between march and april to billion between april and june considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was an increase in the repurchase agreements totaling with a increase in total stock from billion on april to billion on june the net redemption of securities by the national treasury was

outlook and baseline data on economic activity since the previous copom meeting reinforce the continuity of the brazilian economy recovery scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment regarding the global the provision of additional monetary stimulus in major in a context of economic slowdown and has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging the outlook remains and risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global growth various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate this includes the components that are more sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at remains at that level over and ends at it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at remains at that level over and ends at in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for in the scenario with a constant exchange rate at and the interest rate path from the focus the conditional inflation projections are around for for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the september copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the combination of the high level of economic slack and the potential propagation of current through may continue to produce a prospective inflation on the other the current degree of monetary which affects the economy with increases the uncertainty about the transmission channels and may raise the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case of a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies or a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the brazilian discussion about the conduct of monetary copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of the available information and they concluded that the data released since their previous meeting reinforce the continuation of the brazilian economic recovery the committee estimates that the gross domestic product growth most likely expanded in subsequent quarters should show some which should be reinforced by the stimuli resulting from the release of fgts and resources impacting mainly the last quarter of baseline inflation scenario assumes that the pace of underlying economic activity which excludes the effects of temporary stimuli will be copom members also evaluated the evolution of financial conditions they concluded that the conditions are despite some volatility inherent to those the environment with favorable financial conditions results from the increase in the degree of monetary the relatively favorable external environment for emerging economies and the prospects for improving the fundamentals of the brazilian as a result of the reform this easing of financial conditions has been more clearly reflected in the dynamics of value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed during the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom credit and capital which are growing at robust rates at this stage of the economic copom members also discussed factors that could affect economic in the context of the deep adjustments that the brazilian economy notably those of fiscal in a context of limited fiscal they emphasized the relevance of the approval of the social security reform by the national but reinforced the importance of the continuation of the reforms and adjustments that contribute to the sustainability of fiscal by reducing fundamental uncertainties about the brazilian these reforms tend to work in the same direction as the monetary policy to stimulate private this potential expansionary effect should counterbalance the impact of current fiscal adjustments on economic as well as mitigate the risks of large increases in risk the copom stressed the understanding that an acceleration of the pace of economic recovery to more robust levels will also depend on other initiatives and microeconomic reforms aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the economic recovery and development of the brazilian initiatives in the structural agenda of the banco central do brasil contribute to this the committee also discussed the characteristics of the current business with lower state participation in the and their possible implications for monetary some copom members pointed out that changes in the credit market and financial such as the greater role played by credit and capital may affect the monetary policy transmission copom members also conjectured about the sensitivity of macroeconomic variables to monetary since we lack historical precedent in the brazilian history for the current degree of given that monetary policy operates with lags in the especially to price the assessed factors tend to increase uncertainty about the monetary policy transmission regarding the global committee members deemed the scenario relatively favorable for emerging on the one central banks of several economies some major economies included have provided additional monetary which contribute to easing global financial on the other the copom judges that the risks associated with a slowing global economy and geopolitical uncertainties uncertainties in the imply risks to assets whose pricing hinge heavily on a scenario with low global interest rates and the maintenance of the recent pace of economic in this the copom members once again highlighted the capability of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of anchored inflation and prospects of continuing structural reforms and of economic the committee members discussed recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying the latter measures are deemed to be at comfortable estimates and projections indicate that the inflation most likely retreated in october to levels near the lows observed during the inflation targeting and should rise again over the last months of the this trajectory reflects a lower than expected nflation in september and a downward revision of the october for the last two months of this the projections of some administered prices have been in offset those disinflationary keeping the inflation projection stable relative to the previous in the scenario with the interest rate path from the focus survey and a constant exchange in the relevant horizon for monetary the scenario with the interest rate from the focus survey and a constant exchange rate results in inflation below the target and slightly below the relative to the previous copom the conditioning factors had contrasting effects on inflation for on the one additional monetary stimulus from lower interest rates contributed to increasing inflation over the relevant on the other some administered price adjustments were brought forward to together with the decline in the focus survey inflation were a vector in the opposite which eventually for relative to the previous copom the main drivers behind the projected decline were the propagation of a inflation and the revision of administered the copom members assessed that the economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at comfortable scenarios with inflation projected below or slightly below target for the relevant horizon of monetary and high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural the committee members expressed the view that the current level of real interest rates provides stimulus to the central do copom the copom reiterates its view that the continuity of reforms and perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy are essential for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest for the full operation of monetary and for a sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its september meeting they unanimously decided to lower the selic rate to the copom also discussed the advisability of providing some perspective on possible monetary policy the committee decided to express its assessment that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit an additional of the same to the degree of monetary the committee discussed the benefits of signaling beyond the next the members of the copom decided to stress that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution when considering possible new changes in the degree of given the decision to clarify the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which best conveys the economic rationality that guides its the copom deemed it essential to emphasize that the communication of this assessment does not constrain its next and to reiterate that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes to a lesser the copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural the copom sees progress in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian but emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes adjusting the degree of monetary lowering the selic rate by percentage the committee deems that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit an additional adjustment of the same the copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution when considering possible new changes in the degree of the committee reiterates that communicating this assessment does not restrict its next and emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation decelerated from in january and in february to in as a inflation accumulated in the first quarter of reached decreasing relative to the level registered in the same period of the previous in the last twelve inflation declined from in december to in march in march the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the first three months of the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated prices considering market both prices of tradable goods and goods cooled on a trailing reaching and in down from and in december despite the acceleration relative to the levels observed in the same month of the previous according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of increased from in december to in january and in and decreased to in march in march preliminary data for april point to consumer inflation above that observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed in the last year has been gradually overcome by a process that should continue to be led by the behavior of market while regulated price inflation should show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed divergent behavior in the first three months of the the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased from in january to in reflecting seasonal and then decreased to in on the other smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures showed lower recording and in and in february and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core remaining in levels above the midpoint of the it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced to in march down from in december to in march the general price index inflation changed in february and in down from in on a trailing the inflation decreased from in december to in compared to in march the slowdown of the has reflected the behavior of its main the wholesale price index which decreased from in december to in on a trailing basis in march on its the consumer price increased in march according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in march regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of agricultural the agricultural ipa reached in march in march while the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached in march it bears noticing despite the effects of the exchange rate depreciation that has occurred since the third quarter of last wholesale industrial prices have showed deflation at the as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased in after falling by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted according to the industrial output increased by in after the expansion observed in on a industrial output retreated by in with respective falls of and in mining and manufacturing the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output series and its at the according to data suggests that production would have reached its lowest level in the industrial activity continues to be influenced by the international due to its effects both over exports and credit and over business and in this some industrial segments have been led to adjust inventories and reduce a process that has recently been particularly evident in the intermediate goods among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of capital goods decreased by in after increasing in regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased in february and in consumer goods production increased in february and decreased in and the production of durable strongly influenced by the automotive sector increased by in after a increase in the recent slowdown in capital goods production reflects the persistence of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business on its the at the in the pace of durable goods production expansion the exemption tax measures and also some easing of credit the future trajectory of industrial production should continue to be influenced by these which counterbalance the deterioration of external demand and the process of inventories adjustment mentioned labor market has continued to record ambiguous combining positive aspects with signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey changed from in february to in march in march according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate increased reaching average real earnings increased by in in and increased in according to the same comparison due in inflation on its expanded by in february and in in as a real payroll increased in january and in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment retreated by in after decreasing by in january and by in december in employment declined and expanded by on a trailing according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment fell in february falling in january and in december totaling a increase in twelve months and a decline still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate some recover in the generation of formal despite below the seasonal in jobs were created to the positive result of in the manufacturing industry recorded the highest dismissal rate in with the reduction of followed by the commerce which habitually hires in this period of the with the reduction of on the other the civil construction sector and the services sector hired workers in the and the result for the civil construction was above the average of the last five years according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after increasing in on a the indicator increased by growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales increased in according to seasonally adjusted after expanding by in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of parts and and personal and domestic the negative key drivers were magazines and and and in the cumulative growth was more significant in material and and magazines and after falls in november and expanded retail sales data for january and february evidence a recovery influenced mainly by the increase in the sales of in response to the sector incentives granted by the government and some recover in the access to vehicle credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of but it will also be affected by the evolution in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in below the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing industry remained stable at in january and without the seasonal in february the nuci stood below the level registered in the same month of on its the monthly adjusted nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas remained stable in march at standing below the level registered in the same month of the reduction in the is also observed in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and civil construction inputs the reduction on calculated by cni and fgv seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic and points to significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing on the other data about the absorption of capital goods indicate continuity of retraction at the margin and compared to the same periods of last the absorption of capital goods decreased in according to seasonally adjusted and by in according to observed in its the production of civil construction inputs showed stability at the margin in after decreasing in falling in evidences suggest an ongoing process of reduction in demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing although the speed of decline in the utilization rates has as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance has been showing moderate growth at the under this comparison the trade surplus reached billion in january and increased to billion in february and to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts on the opposite the reduction in remittances of profits and dividends has contributed to limit the current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress on international financial which originated in the us and but whose impact on emerging economies has continued to be the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the us and using wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary have moderated the perception of systemic in this there are albeit of reduction in risk but the return of confidence remains due to the susceptibility of the markets to the flow of economic and despite the decrease both in the risk aversion and in the scarcity of capital flows in the recent weeks encouraged the recovery of emerging currencies against the us regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary the currently predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in which would recover just in the consensual projections point to an intense retraction of activity in the europe and which be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in europe and parts of asia was in a significant manner due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices in which was allowing an increase in available income in these on the other the problems in the international financial system have continued to be aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of focused on the us and which tends to reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions as a the risk of intensification in the in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has decelerated considerably and for a longer inflationary pressures have reduced the disinflation process seems to have gained momentum also in the emerging in spite of greater persistence of the inflation in this monetary policies stances have become highly expansionist in the mature while the expansionary stance in the emerging economies has been more at the same the authorities in the western europe and asia have been announcing a series of important initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal which could contribute to a gradual economic important to that the estimates on the fiscal costs for macroeconomic stimulus and support packages to the financial sector have been which has caused pressures over the risk assessment of several sovereign even in advanced oil prices remain but showed important elevation relative to the levels observed at the last copom future markets quotations also uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the prospects for the evolution of global in a scenario of uncertainty regarding the implementation and maturation of in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in remains but if the current scenario in the oil market it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis of price reductions in it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline the reduction in international oil observed since the second half of can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation the behavior of agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact in the evolution of food such as soybeans and was heterogeneous since the last copom with a predominantly upward of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following similarly to the march copom the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone for was kept unchanged at relative to the march copom while the expected adjustment for electricity prices was reduced to the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was reduced to down from considered at the march copom this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total march the projection for regulated prices inflation for remained unchanged at compared to the march copom such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in in comparison to considered at the march copom the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations office the ipca reduced to down from for inflation expectations reduced to down from collected on the eve of the march copom considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca decreased relative to the figure considered at the march meeting and is significantly below the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also decreased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom meeting and is also significantly below the central inflation inflation projection for based on the benchmark and market showed stability relative to the last copom on the benchmark the projection remained significantly below the central while on the market scenario it is around the central policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic available data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion has significantly since the third quarter of partially as a reaction to the substantial and generalized economic activity deceleration in other developed and emerging on its the increase in risk aversion and the constraint observed in liquidity conditions prevailing in the international markets observed so despite some marginal continue to impose adjustments in the balance of since the last copom some early signs of a global risk aversion although still subject to have with impacts on both brazilian assets and and also influencing financial it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price in several evidences significant reduction of external inflationary especially over mature but also over some emerging the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to until the present predominantly the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risk to the domestic inflation trajectory continues to evidences of substantial accommodation of domestic demand and moderation of pressures over the market of despite remaining subject to should reduce the risk of of upward pressures stemming from wholesale prices apart from have showed deflation over the past few over consumer the committee evaluates that the materialization of such as well as the generalization of pressures initially located over consumer still depends critically on economic inflation inflation expectations for and retreated since the last copom meeting to levels below the but continue to be closely it is worth noticing according to available domestic demand behavior should exert less pressure over prices of such as in the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation these considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened prospects for the evolution of economic activity have improved since last copom although industrial data still partially reflects an retreat in light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial the credit contribution to sustain domestic demand severely although there are some early signs of in particular relative to credit to the severity of the international crisis negatively influenced consumers and businessmen but there are also signs of under such despite some improvement on financial the resumption of economic activity will strongly depend on real payroll expansion and the effects of governmental transfers that should occur in in the contracting effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which monetary policy has been can become but will not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the second half of and in the copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism has generated an increase in the idleness margin of resulting on reduction of inflationary on the other remaining risks to the inflationary dynamics derive from the trajectory of brazilian assets despite some recent associated to the partial recovery of commodities amidst a process of decreasing external funding as well as price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior of the prices of services and regulated items since the beginning of the balance of those influences over the prospective trajectory of inflation will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk both for private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation resumes the midpoint target path in as established by the to keep it in a level consistent with the target path for such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of signs of economic activity for industrial production indicators in some by the continuity of the inventory adjustment of data available for the labor market and industrial capacity utilization as well as for businessmen and consumers and of lower inflation expectations for relevant the prospects for the materialization of a benign inflation in which the ipca would resume evolution in line with the target have continued to the evolution of the prospective scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the as well as on inflation expectations set by independent the committee also understands that the improvement on the inflation prospective scenario for and has not so incorporated into the interest rate forward although there is still some scope for an easing the monetary policy should be cautiously aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets the committee understands that the demand stimulated by tightening of financial conditions and by the deterioration of the although some marginal improvement has been observed in both as well as by the global economic activity has created a significant idleness margin of production factors that may not be rapidly eliminated in a scenario of gradual recovery of economic such development should contribute to restrain the inflationary even in light of the consequences of the adjustment process of the balance of payments and the presence of mechanisms of inflation feedback in the making room for a monetary policy easing the copom assessment over the scope for additional monetary which depends on the inflation prospects relative to the targets takes into account the fact that changes on the basic interest rate have effects over activity and inflationary dynamics that accumulate over the committee understands that the continuity of the monetary easing process makes urgent the update of resulting from the long period of high still embedded within the financial system institutional in such taking into account the macroeconomic scenario and aiming to enlarge the monetary easing the copom has unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to without under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a long period of domestic demand has started to exert a contractionist influence over economic despite the persistence of incentive such as income it bears noticing that inflation expectations for and have decreased since the last copom on the other the deceleration of global economy has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial despite the exchange rate under such the monetary policy can be eased without jeopardizing inflation convergence to the targets if the risk profile deteriorates in such a manner that implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic scenario considered by the committee at this the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the at the end of the it was announced that the committee would reconvene on june for technical presentations and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom the ipca increased in up from in reaching in the first quarter of in the last twelve months through the ipca increased compared to in in there was deceleration on market prices up from in and on regulated prices up in the previous in the last twelve market prices reached and regulated prices increased compared to and in the core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in decelerating relative to the increase observed in reaching on a trailing the smoothed trimmed means core reached up from in increasing in the last twelve the trimmed means core reduced in march relative to the previous month reaching in the last twelve the diffusion index reached up from observed in the decreased in after a decrease in reaching in the first quarter of and in the last twelve the ipa price decreased in reflecting the reduction both in crop and livestock sector prices and in industrial prices on a the ipa increased with a increase in industrial products prices and a decrease in agricultural it bears highlighting that significant deceleration in the last twelve months through december and totaling and the increased in february and in reaching and respectively on a the incc recorded in a record low for the series since april on a trailing the incc reached core increased in up from in reaching in the last twelve analyzing the ipa by stages of the prices of final and intermediate goods and gross raw material reduced and in in the last twelve months through march those prices increased and partial inflation results for april indicate increase on consumer prices and a slowdown on the deceleration pace of wholesale the increased in reflecting higher increases on personal housing and as for according to the april general price there was an upturn in the prices of agricultural which increased in the and continuity of the fall in industrial economic activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly survey expanded retail which include construction supplies and vehicles and parts and increased in reflecting the increase in the sales of seven out of the ten segments with highlights for the performance of vehicles and parts and pieces which benefited from the ipi products sales of construction material grew after four consecutive months of falling among the segments that presented decrease in sales relative to it bears emphasizing the negative performance of books and magazines and stationary were which fell considering comparisons between identical periods of and the increase on expanded retail sales increased in growing by in the first two months of in it bears emphasizing the performance of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies office material and equipment and other personal and domestic items the negative drivers were construction material clothing and shoes and furniture and home appliances são paulo trade association related to the city of são indicate the continuity of expansion on retail with increases of on database consultation for credit sales and on consultations to the usecheque system in on a seasonally adjusted those indicators showed in march a decrease and a in the first quarter of the indicators decreased and automobile sales by which take into account light commercial trucks and increased in seasonally according to fenabrave of auto vehicles on the first quarter of sales reached thousand a increase despite the reduction on trucks regarding investment capital goods production decreased in while the production of construction typical inputs remained stable in the seasonally relative to the same period of those indicators decreased and in february and and in the first two months of capital goods imports increased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the march indicator increased expanding by in the first quarter of compared to the same period of last interrupting the downturn trend observed in the last according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in seasonally sixteen out of the activities surveyed reported monthly production with highlights to the performance of automobile vehicles other chemical products publishing and printing and electronic material and communication equipment by use still considering seasonally adjusted it bears highlighting the increases in the production of durable consumer goods and consumer goods and intermediate goods industrial production decreased in as a reflex of a decline in all use capital goods durable consumer goods intermediate goods and and consumer goods the cumulative industrial production declined in to the twelve months through when industrial production expanded by according to the same comparison cni indicators showed a recovery in the industrial activity in with increases of in real revenues and in hours worked in according to data seasonally adjusted by the the installed capacity utilization declined in the same these indicators decreased and vehicles production reached thousand units in according to decreasing considering seasonally adjusted the production of vehicles increased in for a increase in the first quarter of this the cumulative production of vehicles decreased by and the production of agricultural machinery increased in the last twelve months through compared to the last twelve months through the domestic sales of vehicles increased in march accumulating a growth in twelve while the exports of vehicles decreased and according to the same comparison the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in march pointed to the production of million tons in up from million tons estimated in the new estimate represents a decrease relative to the declines of and in the production of corn and were also the production of grains directly related to the basic food such as rice and should expand by and and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index decreased in reflecting a reduction in the consumer expectations index and the increase in the current economic conditions index the icc declined mainly due to the retraction of in the according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the the icc increased in the confidence increase reflected the monthly increase in the components relative to consumer whose impact in the composition of the general index overcame the effect of the decline observed in the component concerning the current the icc declined in relation to the expectations for the manufacturing the fgv manufacturing industry survey in for the third consecutive a slight improvement in the businessmen although the industry confidence index is at a relatively low when compared to the average of the icc reached after seasonal with increase of reflecting the increases of increase in the current situation index and in the expectations index according to the same the installed capacity utilization reached in below the march considering the seasonally adjusted the nuci observed in stood above the level registered in market according to the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in march after a thousand balance in totaling thousand jobs in twelve among economic services and the construction sectors registered an increase in the number of jobs in the period thousand and while the manufacturing industry and the retail sector recorded thousand and thousand seasonally adjusted data showed a decline in the employment level in in the first quarter of the this indicator increased influenced by increases of in the construction in the services sector and in the retail according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate increased in march to up from in february and in march the monthly increase reflected the increase in the economically active population due to the stability in the employment the increase in the unemployment rate was driven by the higher increase in the pea relative to the increase in the number of employed the same survey pointed out that average real earnings of employed workers reached in decreasing but continued to expand significantly on a basis and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in increasing by in monthly terms and on a trailing this volume corresponded to of compared to december and march credit operations increased and in the last twelve among the which represent a share of in the total of the financial credit operations to individuals increased and in the last twelve while credit operations to corporate increased and earmarked credit operations increased and on a trailing with highlights to the monthly increase in housing despite the the leasing operations in the individuals segment continue losing momentum at the with a reduction of growth on a trailing basis from in october to in considering the segmentation by economic the loans to industry increased and expanded in the last twelve the average interest rate on credit used as reference for interest reached in compared to in december and in march the average rate on credit for individuals decreased relative to reaching the average rate on corporate credit decreased by relative to reaching delinquency rates in the financial system used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety stood at in a increase delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate and individuals reached and compared to and in march net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in up from in the same month of environment although many international financial market indicators have improved since the last copom the sustainability of this movement is still the conditions of credit markets in mature economies are still under with banks limiting the access to the spreads of credit default swaps of banks and corporate remain in high although they have shown significant reduction in the final demand for goods and especially the one related to household signalizes stability in the us and in the euro the increase in the family savings continues to be the main theme in the definition of consistency and pace of consumption private investment continues in leading to unemployment rate both in mature and emerging the recent estimates of the international monetary fund point to decline in global gdp in contraction in relation to the last january estimate as well as to an decline in international trade in regarding the global recession outlook has contributed to disinflation in some to deflation of energy and food which has been confirmed by the disinflation for in the euro area and or as observed in china and in the in the the cpi accumulated in twelve pressured by the reduction in energy declined to in in the same the respective cpis indicate deflation of in china and inflation of in euro regions where inflation reached and in june considering the or even a of credit the crisis in the financial systems and the behavior of central banks from mature economies and also from emerging economies furthered the monetary policy in addition to the continuous injections of capital in their local the annual interest rates were lowered to and in the euro area and the same stance was for by the central banks of new zealand and south with interest rates at and japan and the united states continue to work with a nominal interest rate policy close to it bears highlighting that in the united japan and in the the central banks have already started the bond purchase aiming to facilitate the reduction of interest rates and the reduce the spread of corporate which should be able to create some impulse in private in where the economic prospects have deteriorated the in addition to the monetary liquidity announced the release of a new fiscal package totaling trillion around of local trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in the first quarter of in the exports reached and decreasing by and on a daily average total external trade recorded billion in an decrease on a daily average the decline in exports in the first quarter signals the cooling of global economic activity and the effects over the prices of the main exports according to the funcex the prices of exports products declined in the while the volume exported reduced in the case of brazilian the contraction of in the same period reflected more intensely the slowdown of domestic economic once the volume index decreased once the price index reduced based on the liquidity international which encompass the repurchase lines and borrowing operations in foreign reached billion in recording a billion increase under the cash international reserves totaled recording a billion increase in comparison to the end of market and open market operations in the period between the march and april copom the interest rates reduced influenced by the benign behavior of the current inflation by the decline in inflation expectations and by the disclosure of data regarding the activity level and the labor considered the and rates showed inverse mainly since the beginning of in reaction to the expectation of a faster recovery of the domestic and international in response to fiscal and monetary stimuli implemented until between march and april and rates decreased by bps and on the other the rates for and maturity increased by bps and real interest measured by the differential between the oneyear forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on march to on april in its open market the bcb carried between march and april and sevenmonth long fixed rate repo the repo operation was carried out for the first time on april and absorbed the average daily balance of these operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of and working days on march of working days on march and of working days on april of working days on april of working days on april and of working days on april these operations draw from the market the following billion and billion the average daily balance of these run borrowing operations reached the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of and liquidity management operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily on march the bcb carried out traditional fx swap auctions for rolling over the contracts maturing on april these operations totaled around of maturing as a the net short position on fx swap contracts reduced from billion to in notional between march and april the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached being billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in october and april combined with purchases of ltns maturing in april and july totaling and conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in september combined with the purchase of lfts maturing in march and june totaling the sales of settled in other national treasury securities maturing in and totaled the treasury also conducted purchase auctions of ltns and totaling billion and update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the environment is becoming less reflecting the persistent inflation and the consequent central growth in should be with the reversal of fiscal stimuli and advance in the process of monetary policy this combination implies a more challenging scenario for emerging turning to the brazilian recently released industrial output and trade indicators show negative and on the other the services segments hardest hit by the pandemic continue on a robust recovery the committee maintained the expectation of a recovery in activity in the second half of the although less intense and more concentrated in the services this reassessment reflects the impact of supply shortages of inputs in some productive which should persist until for if on the one hand the rise in risk premia and the tightening of financial conditions act stifling the economic on the other copom considers that economic growth will be benefited by three the continued recovery of the labor market and the services the performance of sectors less dependent on the business cycles such as agriculture and livestock and the extractive and the remaining effects of the normalization of the economy as the health crisis consumer inflation remains high and has been more persistent than price increases are more widespread and also include items more associated with core the increase of industrial prices has not slowed down and should persist in the short whereas services inflation accelerated due to the gradual normalization in the as besides these since the previous copom meeting there has been a substantial increase in international energy commodity whose inflationary impact is amplified by the brl they are the preponderant factor for the increase in the inflation projections for both and the various measures of core inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that rises to in and to in ending the year at and drops to during in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the energy flag is assumed to be in december and level in december of and risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the recent increase in the price of international commoditiesmeasured in local currency would produce a inflation in the baseline on the other further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the risk despite the more positive public accounts the committee assesses that recent questioning regarding the fiscal framework increased the risk of deanchoring inflation raising the upward asymmetry in the balance of this implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the baseline discussion about the conduct of monetary the public accounts have performed better than assuming the current fiscal framework is in particular the control of spending projections foresee a falling trajectory for the public debt as a percentage of between relevant questionings arose regarding the future of the current fiscal resulting in higher risk these questionings have also raised the risk of deanchoring inflation increasing the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks for the conduct of monetary this implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest the committee reiterates that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic weaknesses in the structural reform effort and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and the exchange rate at purchase power the inflation projections are above the target for and around the target for the committee pondered that the asymmetry in the balance of risks resulting from the developments in the fiscal scenario implies an increase in the upward risk to its baseline scenario projections and assessed that this upside bias is now larger than previously the committee concluded that the appropriate degree of monetary tightening is significantly more contractionary than that used in the baseline in view of copom assessed the appropriate pace of interest rate to this it analyzed the convergence of inflation to targets using simulations with different monetary policy paths under different alternative the committee pondered at this shocks in commodity prices already impact the raising their copom understands that a process of deanchoring inflation expectations may cause high economic costs in the long term and thus decided to choose a pace of interest rate hikes compatible with the convergence of inflation to the target still in the committee also considered scenarios with adjustments greater than the prevailing was that monetary policy tightening paths with considering different ending are consistent with inflation converging to the target in even considering the current asymmetry of the balance of monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to the targets over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes and without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given the deterioration of the balance of risks and the increase in its inflation this pace is the most appropriate to guarantee inflation convergence to the targets at the relevant at this the baseline scenario and balance of risks indicate as appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening even further into the restrictive for the next the committee foresees another adjustment of the same copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda rumenos manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation increased to in september up from in returning to the level observed in as a in the year through september inflation reached decreasing relative to the same period of the previous in the last twelve inflation reduced to in september down from in august in december and in september remaining near the the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the first nine months of the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated price inflation considering market both prices of tradable and goods cooled on a trailing reaching and in down from and in december and in the same month of the previous according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of increased to in september up from in december in september preliminary data for october point to consumer inflation above the level observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary acceleration cycle observed last year has been gradually overcome by a process led by the behavior of market specially while regulated price and services inflation continue to show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased between august and the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices changed from in july to in august and in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures also recording and in and in august and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and nonsmoothed trimmed means core it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced from in december to in september to in september the general price index inflation changed from in july to in august and in on a trailing the inflation changed from in july to in august and in september in september the slowdown of the has basically reflected the behavior of all its three its main the wholesale price index reached in the last twelve months through september in september on its the consumer price indexbrazil increased in september in september and the civil construction national index increased in september regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached in september while wholesale industrial prices reached in september as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation the ibge released gdp which showed a contraction in under the criterion of the from the aggregate demand expansion was led by the household consumption and public administration which increased and gross fixed capital exports and imports contracted and according to the same comparison the contribution of domestic absorption to output growth was in the second quarter of overweighing the positive contribution of the external from the aggregate supply still according to the the services sector performed with a while all the other sectors the gdp deflator measured by market according to the same comparison changed from in the fourth quarter of to in the first quarter of to in the second quarter of on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in july and still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output increased by in july and in the eighth consecutive month of on a industrial output retreated by in july and in with respective falls of and in manufacturing and mining the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output and its suggests that production reached its record low in and has been followed by gradual industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international by business and as well as by the developments of domestic financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the similarly to the observed in it bears highlighting the increase in august in the durable consumer goods strongly influenced by the automotive regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased and consumer goods production increased while the production of capital goods increased by the at the in the dynamism of industrial led by production of durable to a great tax exemption measures and also some easing in credit the future behavior of industrial production which should not be uniform over will depend on these as well as on the evolution of consumer and businessmen counterbalancing the still emerging recovery of external labor market has behaved more with resilient aspects prevailing over signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey changed from in july to in august in august according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate remained unchanged at the same level reached in june and average real earnings increased by in in on its expanded by in according to the same comparison as a real payroll reached in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that the generation of formal employment has continued to record significant in thousand jobs were created to the positive result of thousand in representing the second best result for the series in the the manufacturing industry showed positive balance of thousand the sixth consecutive month of expansion and the best result of the series for the the commerce sector continued the recovery trajectory initiated in with the positive result of thousand the civil construction the most dynamic one with a cumulative growth in and the services sector continued hiring workers this and thousand the agricultural and livestock on its lost thousand according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after retraction of in on a the indicator increased by growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after recording in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of parts and and food beverages and the negative key drivers were material and and clothes and in the cumulative growth was more significant in information technology and communications material and and and medical after consecutive falls in the last months of expanded retail sales data have evidenced mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to the improvement in the access to vehicle credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit influenced by the lagged effects of monetary policy and by the evolution of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in below the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the but above the record low reached in the series seasonally adjusted by cni changed from in to in considering the monthly series without seasonal in august the nuci was below the level registered in the same month of on its the monthly nuci without seasonal calculated by fundação getúlio vargas increased in september to up from in below the level observed in the same month of the reduction in the nuci according to the comparison is also observed in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and construction inputs the same seasonally adjusted by changed from in august to in increasing relative to the record low observed in and is close to average of the the reduction on the nuci calculated by cni and according to the same comparison results from a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic and points to some idle capacity in the manufacturing data regarding the absorption of capital goods show retraction compared to the same periods of and expansion at the the absorption of capital goods data indicate stability in august a increase in a increase in the quarter ended in compared to the quarter ended in according to seasonally adjusted and a decrease of in according to observed on its the production of construction inputs increased by at the margin in august increase in the after a decrease in accumulating a fall in the in evidences suggest that demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry are although the utilization rates have increased in the last as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance reduced at the according to the same comparison the trade surplus reached billion in decreasing to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the greater resilience of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the recent narrowing of trade the reduction in remittances of profits and on its has contributed to limit the trailing current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress reduction in international financial despite not in a monotonic the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in mature using a wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary have continued to moderate the perception of systemic in this the signs of reduction in risk aversion as evidenced by the behavior of international equity although this process remains subject to the improved trend of risk aversion and of the scarcity of capital as well as some concern among investors about the fiscal situation in the continued to encourage the recovery of both from emerging and mature against the us regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary but recovery of economic activity seems to have been the current predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in followed by recovery in the consensual projections point to a retraction of activity in the europe and japan which be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences of gradual recovery in the economic but still subject to particularly due to the weakness in the labor market and economic activity in on the other the risk that the problems in the international financial system become aggravated by the cyclical deterioration in the quality of credit which could contain the distension in financial conditions as a hinder the consolidation of economic recovery still but it seems to be the prospect of deflation in mature economies has despite the on a trailing of the disinflation process in several emerging in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy in a significant number of monetary policy seems to have begun a phase of stability in some started a period of reversing the stimulus introduced during the sharpest international contraction whereas the increase in public sector debt imposes limits on the scope of any additional fiscal oil including future markets have increased significantly since the last copom uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in the context of global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investments maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive such as the as well as through the effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact in the evolution of food such as soybeans and had heterogeneous behavior since the last copom while quotations of metallic industrial such as and showed relative of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following similarly to the september copom the projected adjustments for gasoline prices for were kept unchanged at while the projection for bottled gas prices rose from to in the same regarding the projected adjustment for fixed telephone and electricity prices for the first one reduced to from percentage considered in the september while the second reduced from to the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was kept unchanged at this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total september the projection for regulated prices inflation for was reduced to from considered in the september such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates a spread in the fourth quarter of and a bps spread in the last quarter of regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and in unchanged relative to the september those figures do not take into account petrobras contribution to the public sector primary surplus and are adjusted by the possibility of reduction by up to in due to the implementation of the investment pilot program and in up to in due to the ppi implementation and the growth acceleration program the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca remained relatively stable in comparison to at the september for the median of inflation expectations increased to up from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for inflation slightly increased relative to the figure considered at the september copom but remained below the target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for remained stable below the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection remained stable relative to the figure considered in the september meeting is close to the midpoint whereas the projection under the market scenario although remaining close to policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic the risk aversion and the liquidity conditions prevailing in international markets continue to show a normalization trend at the in since the last copom signs of global risk aversion reduction have continued to despite still subject to with impacts over both brazilian as well as over selected which had also been influencing domestic financial it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary the impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path continues to until predominantly on its the possible consolidation of the world economy to a certain has been reproducing the disequilibrium observed in the period prior to the might although in a heterogeneous the global inflationary on the top of it should be added the uncertainty generated by the effects of the unprecedented liquidity expansion on mature over the price behavior of both assets and the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized pressures impose risks to the inflationary trajectory remains the moderation of domestic demand pressures over the market of at least in the short should contribute to contain the risk of of possible upward pressures over consumer prices stemming from wholesale the committee understands that the materialization of such as well as the generalization of initially localized over the consumer still depends critically on economic inflation inflation expectations for and remain in line with the targets path and continue to be closely it is worth noticing that the domestic demand behavior tends to exert less pressure over such as over the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity have continued to improve since the last copom although industrial data remain reflecting the relative accommodation of external in light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial credit contribution for the support of domestic demand but signs of recovery continue to in particular regarding loans to the severity of the international crisis negatively impacted consumers and businessmen but also in this case there are consistent signs of under such the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll on the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and on incremental governmental which will occur in the upcoming it should also benefit from the easing of financial in the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous copom meetings minutes that the contractionist effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which the monetary policy could become but would not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have concentrated impacts in the copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism that occurred at the end of caused an increase in the idleness margin of production factors resulting in reduction of inflationary on the other the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario on the short from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and certain regulated items since the beginning of as well as from a possible hike in commodities on the medium the risk stems from cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing and from the fiscal stimulus over the evolution of domestic taking into account the dynamics of consumption and in a context of recovery of production factors the balance of such influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk for both private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation remains in a level consistent with the target path in and such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the idleness margin of the and the behavior of inflation expectations for relevant the materialization of a benign inflation in which the ipca would continue to evolve according to the target has remained by the such evolution of the forwardlooking scenario continues to be reflected on the inflation projections considered by the under such in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflationary under a macroeconomic scenario with significant the copom evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious aiming to assure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets the committee understands that the accommodation of motivated by the tightening of financial conditions and by deterioration of the as well as by the global economic activity could have been although significant idleness margin of production factors still which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic the copom also highlights that there are uncertainties around such basic which should be clarified over the upcoming with both positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity under such scenario of gradual which has been corroborated by current available inflationary pressures should remain on the other the committee notices that the significant monetary policy implemented between january and will have cumulative effects over the which will be evidenced with a time the committee understands that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the total adjustment carried out between january and whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over in a context of gradual recovery of production factors the copom also understands that a more cautious stance will contribute to mitigate the risk of abrupt reversals of monetary policy in the future to the consistent recovery of the economy over the upcoming the copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates to be closely monitored over under such in light of the inflation prospects for the targets the copom has unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without taking into on the one the monetary policy easing implemented since january on the other the idleness margin of production among other the committee evaluates that such level of basic interest rate is consistent with a benign inflationary contributing to assure the maintenance of inflation in line with the targets path over the relevant horizon for the recovery of economic under the inflation targeting the copom guides the decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a short period of domestic demand started to show signs of due to the stimulus factors such as income it bears noticing evidencing the credibility achieved by the copom on the implementation of the inflation expectations for and remain in line with the targets it is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial on its important monetary and fiscal stimuli were introduced into the economy over the last quarters and should contribute to the activity recovery to the reduction of the idleness margin of production those stimuli effects should be closely monitored over time and are important in the context where future monetary policy which should ensure the materialization of the convergence to targets path over relevant will be at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on december for technical presentations and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom ipca inflation reached in up from in totaling a increase in the nine first months of and a increase in the last twelve the housing group increased in september relative to in and was the key driver over the september ipca result market prices increased from in

of global economic preliminary data suggest that economic already observed in japan and in some emerging has spread to other with highlights to the usa and the euro recent projections from the international monetary fund indicate a change in global economic activity in up from the july for the imf projects global growth at up from in the previous signs of industrial production recovery in the developed countries although they have slowed in the last months in data through august show that the the euro area and japan recorded four and six consecutive months of positive monthly since china has recorded increasing growth rates on an annual the consumer price indices through september recorded deflation in the usa and in the euro area with data up through japan recorded a the persistence of low rates of installed capacity added up to the stability of inflationary expectations in the should continue to contribute inflation does not become a problem in the and in the

inflation as measured by ipca national consumer price continues to converge to targets established by the national monetary council such performance confirms assessments made in previous which highlighted prospects for a benign scenario going after presenting some stability in february and march inflation fell substantially in april thus providing for an accumulated in the first four months of the comparing to for the same period of trailing inflation was down from in january to in a record low since july the april performance was greatly favored by virtual stability in market as well as deceleration in regulated prices after increasing in the first fuel alcohol prices reversed and diminished in the food prices continued to a tendency that will probably revert in coming a benign inflation scenario with ever more favorable prospects for target attainment in and positive spillovers to performance in coming benign headline inflation performance in april was also reflected in core inflation core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices fell strongly from in march to in a record low since july the trimmed means core fell from to the lowest since november the smoothed trimmed means core fell only from to in trailing core inflation has been decreasing since accumulating reductions in excess of basis in the core inflation in its three measures and smoothed trimmed stands at and as compared to and in the first fourmonths of after contracting for two the general price index was largely stable in april accumulating in the year so against the registered last in the twelve months to registers negative the lowest ever since beginning of calculation in as had already happened in february and the wholesale price component was the main driver of the falling in such contraction was facilitated by continued deflation in agricultural prices on top of the negative in april also saw trailing standing at and for the year so agricultural ipa was of remarkable in twelve and to the year through in spite of recent international commodity pricing wholesale may continue to contribute favorably to consumer price both in the near and in the longer as stated in recent continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for future inflation gdp at market prices grew in the first as compared to the same period of the highest rate since the first quarter of over the previous seasonally adjusted data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics indicates the highest since fourth quarter of year when a expansion was as compared to the first quarter of mining had an outstanding performance with construction was up and aggregated manufacturing was up services grew and agricultural and farming sectors went domestic absorption led the gdp and all demand components grew as compared to the first quarter of capital formation was up and imports grew external demand contribution to gdp was negative in percentage highlighting domestic demand inventories contributed in line with the adjustment process initiated in the second half of household consumption went up robust making for approximately of according to seasonally adjusted data from industrial production was slightly down in both in comparison to february and using moving if compared to march last production is up on basis it is up confirming a recovery initiated in the last quarter of prior minutes had mentioned the fact that industry should grow in at a pace superior to that of data also let clear the after eleven months of moderation of february presented a largely confirmed in march industry recovery was in view of the monetary easing lagged inventories adjustment is near leading and coincident april data show moderate growth in comparison with in comparison to march last capital goods production expanded brisk and durable goods went along with capital goods production accelerated for the second consecutive month in a after a deceleration fundação getúlio vargas survey on investor sentiment reveals over half consulted companies have an intention to invest more this year than they did in capital goods up to march present significant as compared to the last first in similar durable goods grew even more on account of real income and credit unemployment was stable at in as measured by this is the lowest april figure since beginning of the in the format it has been calculated from there was a reduction of if compared to april in spite of a expansion in the economically active employed persons were up also against april evidence suggests improvement in labor market partly reflecting macroeconomic real income was higher in april as compared to and as compared to april last helped by lower according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment rose in against march in the first quarter of over the same period of employment reached formal employment accelerated at the start of as measured by the ministry of labor and employment it expanded from february to seasonally april saw an increment of some over and of over the retail sales increased in as compared to march last the first two months of the year had been very standing out of patterns observed since may first quarter growth pulled back to against the same period of whether or not march deceleration means a return to the previous pattern is an issue that will have to wait for in recent performance of sales more sensitive to income and employment has been the favorable dynamics of sales also seems to be part of this general which has developments in real wages as a preliminary data already suggest continuity and strengthening of the supported by further and employment to the remainder of the other factors must also namely the ongoing monetary a recovery in consumer and the new minimum manufacturing capacity utilization was practically stable in march against recorded in according to cni seasonally adjusted first quarter average was below the average for first at least this reflects capacity recent data points to investment both related to capital goods and construction in the first capital goods absorption increased as to the same period of last capital goods imports contributed strongly to such growing in as well as construction which grew on the same in spite of evidence pointing to aggregate demand supply side developments apparently head off the possibility of any potentially relevant prior minutes have emphasized the importance of current and prospective developments in aggregate supply and demand in defining future inflation recent data confirm the strong performance of the trade balance in underscoring the point made by copom in previous referring to the important structural changes in the trading links with the rest of the through the trade surplus hit higher than in the same period of last for the first time since the trading balance result of a month was inferior to previous such moderation was already and is not to pose any threat to exports just set a new record high of billion in the through the same was valid for imports in the period the current account surplus was of million in its trailing registered equivalent to of the external environment changed significantly since the april volatility increased markedly as sizable portfolio shiftings have taken consequent upon uncertainty to the timing and magnitude of the ongoing us tightening short run instability had an impact on many as well as on emerging markets risk over the intermeeting the exchange rate went from to per us and brazilian sovereign as measured by the emerging markets bond index plus increased from basis points to copom members see such instability as most likely a the sound fundamentals of the brazilian economy should contribute to weather the consistent inflation robust trade adequate primary fiscal international reserves domestic public debt profile and the buyback of external sovereign a noticeable progress in the resilience to shocks is evidenced by its unabated growth performance in the face of us interest rate adjustment copom continues to assign low probabilities to a significant deterioration in international financial market one that could measurably affect brazilian external financing another concern regards oil which have retreated somewhat in the intermeeting but still standing high and presenting huge recent performance reinforces the idea that prices sustain longer at levels previously deemed great uncertainty continues to prevent reliable forecasting of future oil on the other past minutes pointed out that these developments also widen risks to materialization of baseline which have become less feasible irrespective of what happens to domestic gasoline international oil price hikes eventually find their way to the domestic either through an impact on specific production chains as for or through deterioration in inflation of inflation trends identifiable shocks and their consequences were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following projections for gasoline and bottled gas adjustments in remained unchanged at as compared to the april meeting projections for fixed telephone lines and household electricity pricing in underwent slight electricity up from to phone lines down from to for all regulated copom maintained a adjustment projection for these items stand for of total april the endogenous determination model keeps indicating inflation for regulated prices in such modelling takes into account market the general price index the exchange and seasonal the var based on selic rate levels and estimates a spread of basis points for the second semester of in the baseline spreads should reach basis points in the last quarter of the and in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be related assumptions considered in the previous meeting are since the march median ipca inflation expectations for as compiled by investors relations group have been decreasing from april to they diminished from to this reduction was mainly driven by downward revision of market inflation expectations for the second ahead inflation expectations were relatively for inflation expectations remained in line with the target established by as mentioned in previous these developments suggest that the recent monetary policy stance has both contained inflationary pressures and contributed to the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario assuming maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period raised relative to the forecast presented in the april but remained below the target for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates consensus exchange rate and selic rate trajectories collected by gerin declined relative to the april and is also below for the benchmark forecast increased as compared to keeping below the target for that on the other the forecast under the market scenario but is still above policy decision copom reaffirms the view that current and expected inflation numbers demonstrate that the monetary stance adopted since september has both contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic economic activity gains momentum at a pace consistent with supply such that it will not trigger significant inflationary in spite of continued volatility in international financial markets due to uncertainties regarding monetary policy in developed and the record highs reached by oil the external outlook remains particularly with regard to brazilian external financing a benign inflation environment continues to despite the likely reversal of favorable factors that subdued and the increased risk stemming from important commodity as in the april the committee emphasizes that the main challenge for monetary policy is to ensure consolidation of these favorable uninterrupted convergence of inflation to the target path and the resulting consolidation of long lasting macroeconomic stability will contribute to the progressive reduction in perceived macroeconomic a process already underway for several wider scope for reduction of real interest rates in the future will naturally copom considers that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability of inflation convergence to the target for this to it is important that inflation indicators remain consistent with the current benign inflation copom emphasizes that there are important lags in monetary policy transmission to economic activity and since the start of the monetary easing in september the committee has reduced the selic rate by basis activity levels have not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates just as effects of the recent activity resumption on inflation have not fully in the coming employment and income expansion and credit growth will continue to sustain economic as mentioned in the april the activity level should also reflect effects of the new minimum wage and the fiscal impulse of the last quarter of and first half of effects of interest rate cuts will add up to other factors that also contribute to demand given the uncertainties surrounding monetary policy transmission and the narrowed gap between current and selic equilibrium copom understands that preservation of the important achievements in disinflation and economic along with job creation and rising real may demand a more cautious monetary this argument is even more relevant in light that monetary policy decisions of the coming months will produce impacts more concentrated in the unanimously decided to continue the monetary easing process begun in the september reducing the selic target rate to without and closely follow the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next at which time it will define the next steps in its monetary policy in an inflation targeting authorities make decisions taking into account projected and using alternative scenarios to macroeconomic variables that have an impact on price even as we consider that recent increases in international market volatility are probably of transitional their consequences in heightening uncertainties associated to future inflation may well impair both ability to evaluate scenarios and private sector expectations monetary policy must remain vigilant so that uncertainty does not feed into the should potentially higher risks affect currently benign prospective policy strategy will promptly be adapted to eventually at the conclusion of the it was announced that copom would reconvene on july for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation ipca increased in decelerating relative to first quarter fuel prices hikes refrained and food prices continued to medicine prices were the biggest contributor to april with a percentage point clothing and electricity with ipca rose an accumulated in the first four months of the and in the last twelve regulated prices grew in april and in the last twelve while market prices increased by and in similar tradables were down in in the while were up in increases were of and on account of exchange rate among other in raised only for

the year and in the twelve months through a decline in agricultural prices pushed overall wholesale to in agricultural ipa fell due to decreases in and such smaller relative to the steep registered in reflects moderation in corn reversal of continued falling in and rises in sugar the industrial prices average was again quite posting against in according to the processing only final goods prices however confirming their own deceleration in down from in the previous intermediate goods and raw material also moderated and against the and of all ipca core inflation measures declined in the april

household food and regulated prices reached against previous and in the trailing core calculated by fgv under the symmetric trimmed means hit in up from the of expansions were of in the first four months of and in the last twelve the ipca diffusion index the number of items registering price increases in the stood at in comparing to in recent developments in consumer prices warrant optimism as to another good performance in favorable trends may benefit from continued falling of fuel prices fuel which should compensate for moderation in food price economic activity gdp is expanding in the first quarter of exhibiting seasonally adjusted as compared to last this is the biggest variation since the end of when a variation was as to the first quarter of gdp is growing at on impact of growth in manufacturing and in farming activities contracted on the demand disaggregation reveals in household in on capital in and in domestic demand contributed to and external demand contributed negative according to monthly retail sales decreased a seasonally adjusted in the result makes for a retail sales expansion of in the first with highlights to the growth in furniture and and for and april data from the são paulo trade association showed a seasonally adjusted increase in database consultations for credit sales and a fall in the number of usecheque in the first four the indicators expanded and compared to the same period of as for investment seasonally adjusted production of capital goods and construction supplies retreated by and in the volume of capital goods imports raised according to in the first compared to the same period of these indicators amount to rises of and in similar capital goods production raised capital goods went up and capital goods for mixed production of equipment dedicated to agriculture was diminished in growth in manufacturing capital goods was below average in acceleration of according to overall industrial production decreased in on a seasonally adjusted but accumulates a rise of as to march in the first industrial production grew processing industries fell and mining raised in march in this compared to the same period of these sectors have grown and three of the four manufacturing categories retreated in seasonally durable goods production fell intermediate goods raised falling in the previous in the first compared to the first quarter of all categories exhibit positive consumer in durable goods capital intermediate disaggregated seasonally adjusted data for manufacturing showed that only of the surveyed segments increased production in the percentage of such segments has therefore fallen to from in january and in with march manufacturing on a moving average basis fell after three consecutive months of a direct consequence of falls in three out of four the decline was mitigated by a largely stable performance of the most important intermediate cni manufacturing data also showed cooling activity in sales and worked hours declined respective and on a seasonally adjusted in the first compared to the same period of last they are both on positive and capacity utilization was stable against at seasonally unadjusted data points to below march automotive production was down in domestic auto sales decreased while exports went back in the first four against same period of growth stood at for for domestic and for export other coincident industrial indicators signal deceleration in both corrugated cardboard shipments and highway tolls in and expectations the survey recorded a elevation of in consumer confidence in its two components namely consumer expectations and current economic conditions this series is now at a peak since beginning of calculation in march for the state of rio de fecomerciorj survey had registered a decrease in consumer expectations in march versus and a decrease relative to march according to consumer confidence declined in relative to previous the component of current situation perception was down equal while expectations for the future contracted by this survey is conducted for a sample of households in seven large cities of the market according to the ministry of labor and new jobs were created in the formal market in largely spread among the many sectors of the on seasonally adjusted formal employment increased manufacturing was on the high with in the year through it is thousand new improving on the thousand recorded last according to the survey in the six main metropolitan the unemployment rate was stable at in and below than april such stability

changed from billion in february to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of global economy faces a period of with high risk and prospects of low since the last copom the assessments regarding the activity in the united states have remained relatively but the risks associated to the scenario of fiscal restraint and the deepening of the european crisis have despite the substantial provision of liquidity by the european central bank in the first quarter of this heightened risks to global financial stability remain due among other the exposure of international banks to the sovereign debt of countries with fiscal as well as the increased political these risks are for in private liquidity shifts among countries in the euro as well as in high assets prices in economies with solid high rates of unemployment for a long coupled with fiscal adjustment the limited scope for countercyclical policy actions and political uncertainty are translated into projections of low growth in mature in the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to indicates weak activity in the euro the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for april suggest moderation in global in activity indicators for in particular industrial production and total external indicate slowdown during the second regarding monetary mature economies have persisted with strongly accommodative core inflation remained at moderate levels in the euro area and considering the relatively moderate prospects for the activity level in these in emerging in the monetary policy bias is which in some with additional countercyclical the price brent oil barrel declined since the last copom but remained above in political instability in important producing it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom international prices of agricultural and metallic commodities fell and relative to the record highs observed in april the changes reach and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a fall of until compared to the peak recorded in february in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was influenced by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in fx it is plausible to affirm that the reduction of growth targets in coupled with the fragility of the global should generate some impact over commodities of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline and bottled gas for were maintained at the same value considered at the april the projected adjustments for for fixed telephone and electricity were maintained at and the same value considered at the april the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark was maintained at the same value considered at the april the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark was maintained at the same value considered at the april copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus target around of without according to the parameters contained in the budget guidelines law it is as a working a primary surplus of billion for around of without according to parameters set out in the draft budget guidelines law for it is as a working a primary surplus of of without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last the main scenario also considers the estimated effects stemming from the current deterioration of the international scenario over the brazilian but without the observance of extreme it is noteworthy that part of this estimated impact is already being observed in recent economic activity and price since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased to from for the median of inflation expectations increased to from specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed to and from and for the median changed to and from and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the april copom meeting and it stands around the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for also decreased and stands around the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection remained stable in the reference scenario and declined in the market but still stands above the midpoint target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since the last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those deriving from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic the committee understands in the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed it also notes in these there seems to be limited leeway for monetary policy and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming in important emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external through the external trade in specific changes in the growth pattern are a development that tends to be until the committee evaluates that the international scenario has shown disinflationary for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among moderation of total moderation in investment flows and tighter credit another transmission channel of great importance is the impact over businessmen the committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment added up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic in other the moderation process the brazilian economy was already experiencing in the first half of last year was intensified by the weakness of the global the copom that although domestic demand expansion has also been prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are with some asymmetry among the several this assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit supply both for individuals and and by the fact that and stands at high the copom that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve which started to retreat in the last quarter of tends to continue the decline to move towards the targets the committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic especially price about the inflation dynamics of in this and in the upcoming the committee understands that this improvement in the sentiment tends to be boosted by the moderation observed in the last quarters in the producer prices the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the copom considers that the deceleration of the brazilian economy in the second half of was deeper than and that recovery has materialized in a very gradual it also notes that recent events indicate the postponement of a final solution for the european financial and that the risks related to the deleveraging process stemming from households and government under way in major economic blocks remain these and other constitute an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level for the the prospective scenario for since the last has maintained favorable the committee also notes according to the main scenario the inflation rate stands around the target in in the copom considers at the present the risks to the inflation trajectory remain the committee also notes until due to the global the external sector contribution has been in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom decided to decrease the selic rate to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da silva and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and on the other the committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the still fragile international these elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that the brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in the interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral according to the are largely permanent in light of the even considering that the activity recovery has occurred more slowly than the committee believes given the cumulative and lagged effects of policy actions implemented so any additional monetary easing movement should be conducted with at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on july for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the

stemmed from billion in exports and billion in which diminished and increased compared to the previous twelve on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the while the foreign direct investment totaled billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the in the global a scenario of low growth prospects in important advanced economies notably in the euro and volatility indicators have responded to the prospects of monetary policy change in the high unemployment rates in coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political are translated into investment decline and low the composite leading released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to signals improvement at the margin in several advanced with prospects of growth above the in constrast to the observed in emerging regarding monetary accommodative stances have prevailed in the advanced in emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and in it is slightly above the price of the brent oil barrel has increased since the previous copom reaching levels close to due to higher geopolitical it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have decreased and the ones relative to metals have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations changed in the twelve months through july of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price for the whole year of was maintained at unchanged relative to the value considered at the july copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly compared to the reduction considered at the july copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions as well as readjustments and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this for the whole year of bottled gas prices are projected to increase by and the fixed telephone tariff is projected to decrease compared to stability and retreat of considered at the july copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated for the whole year of remained at the same value considered at the july copom and the projected cumulative adjustment for the set of regulated prices in was maintained at the same value considered at the july copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus trajectories for is considered as the fiscal according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law project since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca slightly decreased from to for the median of the inflation projections decreased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation remained stable relative to the value considered at the july copom it remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast increased relative to the value considered at the july as a it stands above the inflation for in the baseline the inflation forecast remained stable relative to the figure considered at the july copom meeting and increased in the market standing both above the for the second quarter of the inflation forecast stays above the target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity this year have with trend of intensification over the relevant horizon for the monetary there are localized improvements in advanced although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of domestic the committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international as well as greater volatility and dollar appreciation trend in the the copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses a more intense domestic activity pace in this and in the upcoming recent information indicate resumption of investments and continuity of household consumption the latter favored by public transfers and by the vigor in the labor which reflects in historically low unemployment rates and in wages in domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than gdp growth rates and tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy by the expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the program of public services among other the committee notes that the speed of materialization of these expected gains depends on the confidence strengthening of companies and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal for the conditions are created so in the horizon relevant for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth strengthens the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit in the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over despite the moderation the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent quarters enable a natural and expected correction in relative for the these movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is also important to highlight for the the aforementioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the secondary effects stemming from and that would tend to materialize over longer can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to show in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the deterioration in the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it is in this the copom understands that it is appropriate to continue the adjustment pace of the monetary conditions continuing the basic interest rate the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without the committee evaluates that this decision will contribute to set inflation into decline and ensure that this trend persists in the upcoming the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to be relatively especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the remaining effects of the policy actions recently these the programs of public services the permissions for the exploration of among create good prospects for investments and industrial on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of businesses and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the ones observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on october for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the

continues to face a period of with prospects of low growth for a long period in important despite the recent accommodation in the volatility and risk aversion high unemployment rates for a long period coupled with the implementation of fiscal the limited space for countercyclical actions and political uncertainties are translated into projections of low growth for mature mainly in the compound leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development related to continued to indicate stabilization in the growth of the united states and as well as weak activity level in the euro area and in the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index related to suggest some marginal especially in the us and in the main emerging even with still moderate activity in the manufacturing regarding monetary advanced economies persist with strongly accommodative inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and negative in unconventional policy announced in mature tend to increase liquidity in their markets and contribute to the decrease in the likelihood of extreme in emerging in the monetary policy bias is which in some with other countercyclical the price of brent oil barrel has remained above since the previous it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom international prices of metallic commodities have strongly increased while those of agricultural commodities have retreated on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a fall of in twelve months until december assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline in is around the projected adjustment for electricity points to a decrease of nearly estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions recently as well as ordinary tariff revisions planned for this fixed telephone tariff and bottled gas prices are projected to remain for the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was increased to up from considered at the november copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the november copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus of according to parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for as a working a primary surplus of around of gdp is the set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations remained stable at specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed from and to and for the medians are and in the same the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the november copom meeting and stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast also increased and stands above the midpoint inflation for in both the inflation forecast is slightly above the midpoint inflation policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investments and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom understands that there were significant structural changes in the brazilian which determined retreat in interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction in risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the ninth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public for the all these transformations are characterized by high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral according to the are largely permanent the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the major economic in this despite identifying decrease in the probability of occurrence of extreme events in international financial the copom considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity remained in mature the space to use monetary policy seems to be limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the next in important emerging the activity pace has supported by the resilience of domestic the committee also highlights evidences of price pressures in metal commodity to some offset by moderation in segments of agricultural and energy the copom evaluates that the pace of recovery in domestic economic activity less intense than previously anticipated is essentially due to limitations regarding the supply given its these difficulties cannot be addressed by monetary policy which par demand control by the despite the weakness of which the increased uncertainties and the slow recovery of domestic demand will continue to be driven by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently as well as by the moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and the copom that domestic activity will continue to be favored by public as well as by the labor market which is reflected in historically low unemployment rates and in wage despite some accommodation at the the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates that the greater dispersion of consumer price increases recently observed and the reversal of tax combined with seasonal pressures and pressures localized in the transportation tend to contribute that inflation shows resistance in the short the copom emphasizes that its main scenario includes more intense domestic activity pace in this year and limited but which have recently regarding the in specific between supply and demand growth the committee highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the copom emphasizes that the outlook for the upcoming semesters indicates moderation in the prices dynamics of some real and financial in the copom highlights that the balance of risks for inflation worsened in the short term and that the recovery in domestic activity was less intense than as well as that some complexity still involves the international in this the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and for the these the programs of public services the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of confidence create prospects for the investment the committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector in expansionary on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario represents an aggregate demand restraining factor restraining aggregate these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal field and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets in this the copom believes that the stability of monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period of time is the most adequate strategy to ensure the convergence of inflation toward the at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on march for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in up from in totaling in compared to in the

november and january and rates fell by and the rates for and maturities declined and the real interest measured by the ratio between the nominal interest rate and the inflation expectation for the

relative to the first quarter of baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual data suggest that the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low readings of traditional measures of industrial capacity utilization in the unemployment regarding the global the provision of monetary stimulus in major in a context of has been able to generate a relatively favorable environment for emerging various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at falls to at the beginning of ends that year at and rises to in it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at at and at in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate at and the interest rate path from the focus survey yields inflation projections around for for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the october copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation on the other in the context of changes in financial the current degree of monetary which affects the economy with increases the uncertainty about the transmission channels and may raise the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case of a deterioration of the outlook for emerging economies or a possible frustration regarding the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the brazilian discussion about the conduct of monetary copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of the available information and they concluded that data released since their previous meeting suggest that the brazilian economy growth has picked subsequent quarters should show some which should be reinforced by the stimuli resulting from the release of fgts and resources impacting mainly the last quarter of baseline inflation scenario assumes that the pace of underlying economic activity growth which excludes the effects of temporary stimuli will be copom members also evaluated the evolution of financial conditions they concluded that the conditions are despite some volatility inherent to those the environment with favorable financial conditions results from the increase in the degree of monetary the relatively favorable external environment for emerging economies and the prospects for improving the fundamentals of the brazilian as a result of the reform agenda and necessary this easing of financial conditions has been more clearly reflected in the dynamics of credit and capital which are growing at robust rates in this stage of the economic some value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed during the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom pointed out that there is evidence of the beginning of a gradual process of financial the committee also discussed the characteristics of the current business with a smaller role for the public sector in the and its possible implications for monetary some copom members pointed out that changes in the credit market and financial such as the greater role played by credit and capital may have an impact on the monetary policy transmission copom members also conjectured about the sensitivity of macroeconomic variables to monetary since there are no historical precedents in the brazilian history for the current degree of copom members judge that changes in the credit and capital markets tend to bolster the power of monetary copom members also reflected on the level of economic some members argued that the latest activity data and the greater efficiency of the credit and capital markets may result in a faster decline in economic slack than and thus produce upward pressure on on the other the members of the committee stressed that the dynamics of the inflation cores measures indicate that the level of economic slack is still regarding the global the committee members deemed the scenario as relatively favorable for emerging central banks of several economies some major economies included have provided monetary which contribute to easing global financial in the relevant horizon for monetary the scenario with the interest rate path from the focus survey and a constant exchange rate results in inflation slightly below the target and around the projections were particularly affected by the effects of the proteins price which occurred more intensely and earlier than the projections consider a direct effect more concentrated in the last two months of this constituting the main factor that increased regarding administered benign conditions for the occurrence of minor adjustments in electricity rates were this process has been occurring in recent months and will probably continue over the next the copom members assessed that the economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at comfortable scenarios with projected inflation below or around target for the relevant horizon of monetary and the high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates structural the committee members expressed the view that the current level of real interest rates provides stimulus to the monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate by percentage to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes to a lesser the copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural thecopomseesprogressintheprocessofreforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian the committee emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic the committee stresses that the perception of the continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic the copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary the copom emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation accelerated in the last quarter of averaging up from in the third quarter and in the second quarter of last in inflation reached above the recorded in november and slightly above

months contributed to reach an inflation of in down from in the lowest annual inflation since the adoption of the inflation targeting in market prices increased in prices contributed while prices accounted for whilst regulated prices increased for the third consecutive inflation stood within the tolerance intervals established by the national monetary inflation acceleration in december was due to the increase in regulated prices up from in mainly driven by the urban bus and not completely offset by the decrease in market prices inflation down from in amongst market tradable prices inflation decreased to in december down from in while prices decreased to down from services inflation stood at in unchanged relative to and slightly below the observed in december in services inflation decreased to down from in partial january already captured by the and underlying inflation suggest that the increasing ipca trend should despite the recent inflation acceleration in the last the most likely scenario is that inflation evolves according to the targets similarly to the headline ipca core inflation measures calculated by the bcb also increased in on a core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased to in up from in november and in smoothed trimmed means core increased to up from in november and in and continued to record the strongest rigidity among the three core after registering reduction in november to down from in the trimmed means core increased to in despite the recent the cores continue to present a downward trend on a except for the core by which slightly according to the same comparison the inflation cores recorded and in compared to and in similarly to the headline both the core inflation by exclusion and the trimmed means core stood below the central target in on the other the smoothed core inflation has converged more slowly to the reaching in and above the central target for the the general price index inflation decelerated in the last two months of to in down from in november and in this deceleration was mainly driven by wholesale price the wholesale price index inflation cooled to in down from in on the other both the and the increased in the downturn in was due to the deflation in agricultural prices in december down from in after several consecutive whilst industrial prices as a the increased in up from in this acceleration was driven by wholesale price and more by the significant upturn in agricultural prices in the second half of the after several months of deflation in the twelve months through the reached in after recording in the twelve months through the agricultural ipa totaled in the as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation industrial according to ibge seasonally adjusted expanded by in october and in compared to the same months last the increases totaled and in the year through industrial production reached while on a trailing industrial output reached the third positive result according to the same comparison and indicating industrial activity on a moving average industrial production increased for the eightieth consecutive month in the expansion in manufacturing activity in november reached out of the activities with seasonally adjusted with highlights to other transportation equipment and beverages for leading and coincident indicators suggest accommodation of the which should not surprise in light of the strong increment recorded in the preceding several incentive including the monetary easing already implemented and the fiscal suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall accelerate in disaggregated industrial data showed seasonally adjusted expansions of in capital goods production and in intermediate goods after two months of but a reduction in durable consumer goods production in compared to the same month last all categories with highlights to the expansions of durable consumer goods production and capital goods production in the year through november these use categories increased by and the strong growth of durable consumer goods production among other the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of the expansion of capital goods production is due to positive prospects for domestic demand and also to the influence of favorable international prices in the purchase of capital goods destined to several industrial labor market performance remains with decreasing unemployment creation of formal jobs and higher purchase power of the unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan areas reached in compared to in october and in november rio de belo horizonte and porto alegre metropolitan areas recorded the lowest unemployment rates for november months since the beginning of the ibge the unemployment rate contracted in all the six metropolitan areas except for rio de which recorded as a the average unemployment rate in the year through november was percentage points higher than that of the same period last notwithstanding the expansion in labor the number of employed people grew in the year through november and in the compared to the same month last indicating that the pace of jobs creation remains still in the purchase power of workers increased a and over the same month last for a expansion in the year through in real payrolls increased in the same an important factor for the growth of aggregate according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment increased a seasonally adjusted both in october and in consolidating a compared to the same months last manufacturing employment grew and in the year through it reached compared to the same period last regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirm the continuity of the ongoing in the number of jobs increased on a seasonally adjusted in the year through the number of jobs expanded by the same rate observed in the last twelve mainly driven by the expansions of in civil construction and in the retail with the creation of jobs in formal job creation reached in in the twelve months through jobs were retail sales continued to expand in november ibge data recorded a seasonally adjusted in retail sales for november and for compared to the same months of last retail sales grew in october and in in the year through retail sales expanded by mainly driven by furniture and domestic appliances sales and and supermarket sales the positive performance of retail sales is not restricted to and but also comprises creditsensitive expanded retail which include the sales of construction material and parts and increased compared to november reflecting expansions of and in the sales of these fostered by positive credit in the year through expanded retail sales expanded by retail sales expansion is expected to continue in boosted by positive labor market and income credit expansion and the effects of the monetary easing as well as by the recovery in consumer installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry reached in november up from in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the considering adjusted the average installed capacity utilization through november stood below that of the same period last since utilization rates have been at higher levels than those observed in the same months of disaggregated indicators compiled by the fgv show utilization rates at historically high levels for civil construction and capital whose production has vigorously despite industrial production average utilization has shown relative which reflects the improvements in the productive in recent data regarding output and absorption of capital goods suggest a robust ongoing expansion of in the through the absorption of capital goods expanded by mainly driven by the increases in capital goods imports volume and in capital goods production civil construction inputs expanded by according to the same comparison despite the ongoing aggregate demand relevant aggregate supply imbalances that could jeopardy the inflation targets are not anticipated in the coming as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust confirming previous copom assessments regarding important structural changes in the brazilian external in the trade balance reached above the level reached in this result was driven by the record results of exports and imports despite trailing surplus through december was lower than the billion record high observed in as a result of domestic demand imports have outperformed on the gradually compressing trade balance as a external results in are expected to be lower than those observed in but still high for the brazilian historical the current account surplus stood at billion in reaching billion in the or of for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of regarding the international the uncertainties regarding the monetary policy stance in the us although additional interest rate increases cannot be the consensus points to the fact that the tightening cycle may have already on the other even though the recession scenario in the us economy seems to be less there are uncertainties about the magnitude of the us economy the uncertainties regarding monetary policy in europe and japan also it bears so the limited effects of the less clear international outlook observed in the last when the concerns stated above were already particularly with regard to the increased risk commodities prices and lower international in after an in the sovereign risk reached historically low levels in the last this fact corroborates recurrent expressed in previous press releases and inflation that the brazilian economy is more resilient to external in this the copom reaffirms that the continued robust and persistent trade adequate public primary the buildup of international improved public debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to external the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external another concern regarding the international oil has continued to oil prices slightly decreased since the last copom contributing to cool down uncertainties associated with its evolution and effects on the world oil prices are below the lowest prices observed in the last due to the exceptionally mild winter in the northern hemisphere and apparent difficulties that opec faced to control in spite of the recent oil prices still present high among other geopolitical tensions and weather the scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in has become more likely to and the risks related to its materialization have decreased despite the stability in domestic gasoline changes in international oil prices affect domestic oil for through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of market inflation assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the december inflation the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both changed to considering the same comparison the projections for household electricity and fixed telephone prices adjustments in were changed to and the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to from inflation these according to the weights released by the represent of the total december the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at as presented in the december inflation this projection for regulated prices is based on the endogenous determination this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the fourth quarter of reaching in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the november copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group decreased slightly to from this decrease was mainly driven by lower inflation projected for the second and third quarters of the the ahead inflation expectations decreased to from for inflation expectations decreased to from as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period decreased compared to the values considered at the november copom remaining below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting also remained below the values considered in the november copom and below the central target for the the projections for according to both reduced relative to the november remaining below the target in the benchmark and above the target in the market monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that besides containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data still do not suggest high likelihood of important pressures over imports expansion has contributed significantly to this complementing domestic production limiting potential inflationary effects of aggregate demand sustained in despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international due to the interest rates increase in industrialized the external particularly regarding brazilian external remains favorable even in a context of moderation in international the favorable external outlook strengthened as international oil prices decreased significantly in the last the prospects for the inflation trajectory remain as in the november the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of future positive the copom evaluates that pressures stemming from food and regulated mainly public transportation fares in some state have driven the inflation since these effects have not exhausted upcoming inflation indicators will likely reflect those due to the nature of such they are expected to be with decreasing intensity throughout without necessarily affecting the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming discriminating and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the greater part of the reduction concentrated in the second half of the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in the november copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in and expected for this the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this given the reasons stated the copom considered as in its three previous the convenience of reducing the selic target by basis the copom members consensually concluded that several factors would justify such and that it would contribute to increase the total adjustment to be there was no consensus that the lower pace of the monetary easing should start at the present three members of the committee voted for a reduction in the selic considering that the current balance of risks justified such on the other the majority of the members of the copom emphasized that the information available at that moment justified a change in the pace of the ongoing monetary easing given the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission the lower distance between the current selic rate and the equilibrium interest and the interest rate cuts implemented since september these copom members understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real demanded a more cautious monetary easing this argument is even more relevant considering the signs of heated aggregate the inflation pressures and the fact that the monetary policy decisions should have concentrated effects in the second half of and the copom decided to reduce in the selic target by basis points to without five votes were for the copom monetary policy while three votes were in favor of reducing the selic target by basis under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price the international scenario remains but new elements of uncertainty came on the other a set of price apparently arises when domestic demand already expands in such an the monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time in case of an exacerbation of the risk factors monitored by the the monetary policy strategy will be promptly adapted to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on march for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation ipca inflation increased in up from in the previous such acceleration was mainly driven by an upturn in transports which contributed for the monthly other groups also showed price with highlights to clothing personal outlays and food and beverages the last two with lower changes than in the previous ipca inflation totaled in the lowest variation since when it reached comparing the two semesters of the index performed posting and in the first and second food and beverages increased by in far below the ipca market prices variation decreased to in down from in for a change in in the tradable and goods prices rose by and regulated prices had a punctual contribution for the ipca acceleration in which did not affect the declining trend observed during the regulated prices variation stood at in compared to in the previous the increased in totaling in the ipa prices the with the largest weight in the decelerated to in december from in for a increase in the the reached in the up from in mainly due to the elevation of urban bus the index totaled in the incc increased in up from in for a elevation in the the deceleration in wholesale price inflation in december reflected the fall of agricultural prices and the slight acceleration in industrial the agricultural ipa reduced down from in with highlights to the reduction in the prices of rice and sugar in the the index rose by the industrial ipa increased in up from in the previous for a elevation in the according to the processing stages of only intermediate goods recorded price increase in december the prices of final goods declined after a elevation in the prices of raw materials decelerated in falling after the increase in the previous in the the prices of raw materials increased by pressuring the ipa prices of intermediate and final goods rose by and all ipca core inflation measures increased in december on a but sustained their declining trend on a trailing including the december except for the stability recorded in the core by exclusion of household food items and regulated the trimmed means core reached in up from posted in increasing to in twelve the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at in up from in totaling in the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in up from in the previous for a expansion in the core calculated by the fgv under the symmetric trimmed means increased to in for a expansion in the economic activity according to monthly retail sales increased a seasonally adjusted in the four activities with seasonally adjusted data with highlights to the increases observed in clothing and shoes and fuel and lubricants retail sales increased in compared to november mainly driven by the increases in furniture and home appliances and and sales expanded retail including civil construction inputs and parts and grew according to the same comparison evidencing increases of and of these driven by favorable credit in the year through retail sales increased by while expanded retail sales reached são paulo trade association data in seasonally adjusted by the showed a decline in database consultations for credit sales and a increase in consultations to the usecheque on a in these indicators expanded by and regarding investment capital goods and civil construction inputs production grew a seasonally adjusted and in capital goods imports fell according to the same comparison in the year through these indicators increased by and compared to the same period of the previous also in the year through capital goods production for energy increased for and of mixed while capital goods production for agriculture fell according to the monthly industrial survey industrial production increased a seasonally adjusted in reaching a record high for the industrial production expanded by compared to the same month of and in the year through for a growth on a twelvemonth trailing according to monthly the growth in industrial production in november reflected monthly expansions of and in mining and manufacturing regarding use capital goods and intermediate output increased by and while consumer goods production fell driven by the decreases in durable goods and goods production seasonally adjusted data for industrial production showed that of the sectors surveyed increased in mainly in other transportation equipment beverages and oil and alcohol refine clothing and perfume and cleansing products and vehicles recorded declines of and the growth in industrial in the year through compared to the same period of was driven by the expansions of in mining and in manufacturing all use categories grew in with highlights to durable consumer goods production capital and goods and intermediate goods production increased by and according to the same comparison seasonally adjusted data for industrial production showed an increase in production in of the sectors boosted by the expansion in the production of office machines and data such as computers and it bears emphasizing the increases of in machines electrical materials and mainly transformers and the growth in mining particularly iron ore and cni manufacturing data showed decreases of in hours worked in production and in real industrial sales in on a seasonally adjusted in the year through these two indicators increased by and compared to the same period of installed capacity utilization reached a seasonally adjusted in up from in the previous without seasonal installed capacity utilization leveled at above the november vehicles production totaled thousand units in decreasing on a seasonally adjusted domestic sales grew and according to the same comparison vehicles production expanded by domestic sales increased by while exports declined by surveys and expectations the survey showed a expansion in the consumer confidence index in both icc components current economic conditions index rose while the consumer expectation index increased by the icc expanded by compared to the same month last according to the fgv which encompassed homes in the seven main state capitals of the the icc increased in recording a increase in the present situation assessment and a improvement in the ahead still according to the industry confidence index which encompasses six items of the manufacturing industry declined in but expanded by compared to december on a there was stability in the assessment about the present situation and deterioration of in the expectations for the upcoming market according to the ministry of labor and new jobs were created in with expansion in the commerce and services sectors and contraction in the manufacturing agriculture and civil on a seasonally adjusted formal employment increased in the year through thousand new jobs were corresponding to a expansion compared to the same period of with highlights to the increase in civil according to the ibge survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate reached in down from in standing below the observed in november average unemployment rate stood at in the year through above the level registered in the same period of as a result of the increases of in the number of employed workers and in labor real average earnings reached in with a increase and a expansion in comparison to november real defined as

reaching delinquency rates for credit operations with individuals stood at decreasing in the month and increasing in twelve net delinquency rates for retail measured by the reached in repeating a seasonal phenomenon caused by the reduction of new registers and the expressive increase in canceled registers in in the the number of new and canceled registers increased and while the average default rate reached compared to in environment global growth should remain robust in despite some deceleration relative to although risks to the concretization of this scenario the stability observed in the us real estate the support to domestic demand in japan stemming from the heated labor market and high private investment levels and the continued expansion of consumption and investment in europe shall not only assure output expansion close to potential levels in the main economic but also support one more year of consistent expansion in international although the cooling of domestic demand in the main economic areas and of international trade expansion and the economic reforms in course in china can decelerate the the chinese gdp growth may remain favoring the demand for intermediate goods and services produced in other asian countries and also the demand for commodities produced in other in the same the continued substitution of alternative energy sources for driven by oil prices elevation in the last should contribute to keep the international prices of these products at high the main risk to this favorable scenario in is the increase of inflationary pressures driven by an eventual elevation in international oil mainly related to geopolitical factors and to cost pressures stemming from us low unemployment trade and international reserves in brazilian foreign trade continued to with new record highs in exports and imports for the total external trade reached billion in the for a billion trade a record high for december and the second highest monthly level for the all results are historical indicating the improvement in brazilian foreign exports totaled imports reached and total external trade totaled for a billion trade in the three first week of january working the trade surplus reached a result of billion exports and billion world economic growth favored the increase in the demand for goods and international mainly commodities in the the elevation in prices prevailed over the expansion of shipped resulting in growth in the three exports it bears emphasizing the ongoing diversification with increase in particularly with regard to manufactured goods with low weight in total and the expansion of exports exports reached billion in with a daily average of a increase over december in the exports of and primary products recorded record manufactured goods external sales reached a increase in the considering the daily primary products exports totaled and with respective increases of and in imports totaled billion in a increase considering daily compared to december fuel and lubricants imports decreased while other imports expanded in the particularly consumer goods imports in imports expanded by measured in daily compared to with increases in all consumer goods mainly automobiles fuels and lubricants capital goods and raw materials and intermediate goods in international reserves totaled increasing billion in the month and billion in the money market and open market operations after the november copom the yield curve shifted particularly the this movement began immediately after the reflecting the committee decision to reduce the selic rate by and lasted for all in light of good results for domestic external conditions also favored this such as prospects of cooling in the us economy and the favorable outlook for inflows to emerging in the beginning of the fomc minutes raised concerns about the us economy employment and activity data released right after that reinforced those concerns in addition to the fall in the prices of commodities in international caused a temporary increase in the longterm rates in local since january data regarding inflation in the in line with contributed to a downturn in the yield between november and january and rates declined and and rates reduced and the real interest rate measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectations decreased to on january down from on november between november and january the bcb conducted two reverse exchange rate swap the first on december anticipated the redemption of the swap due january and reached the february maturity rollover was accomplished on january and totaled in its open market the bcb carried from november to january weekly and long fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations amounted of which billion were in the same the bcb also conducted overnight repo of which aimed at draining the excess liquidity from the the bcb also conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to operations with tenors less than thirty including the daily liquidity management averaged between november and january the national treasury raised a total of of which billion in billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of and for securities maturing in and and for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in july and october in october and april conjugated to the purchase of ltn or lft maturing in totaling the treasury also conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in and totaling accepting as payment lfts maturing in or in the first half of the treasury conducted auctions to buy ltns maturing in january and april and with several totaling billion and as anticipated in the last copom ipca inflation subdued in to from in accumulating in the third consecutive annual reduction the lowest annual change since the inception of the inflation targeting for the second year in a the inflation target established by the national monetary council was the lower inflation in december was due to decelerating prices for both regulated prices and food prices perishable the ipca diffusion index fell in december relative to the previous to from some acceleration is expected for the january since there might be some price increases in urban transportation in belo and in addition to the effect of the fuel alcohol partial data referring to january suggest that the ipca increase shall be higher than the expected when the december copom meeting was in line with headline two core inflation measures also decelerated in smoothed trimmed means and trimmed means cores rose and compared to and in on the other core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated rose from to despite the december trimmed means cores rose in the relative to the previous quarter from per month for the smoothed core and to from for the while the core by exclusion was practically despite respectively at and trimmed means and exclusion cores ended close to the headline inflation smoothed trimmed means core rose in the the downward trend that characterized overall inflation in the general price index rose in the lowest change in three this decline was mainly due to the deceleration of the wholesale price component which fell compared to a rise in for the and increased and the deceleration of wholesale price inflation in december was mainly due to industrial since agricultural prices remained stable relative to trailing agricultural ipa stood at through while industrial ipa increased in the the lowest change since there are consistent signs of accommodation in wholesale price with potential positive spillover effects on consumer prices in the coming as emphasized in recent copom the continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation according to seasonally adjusted data published by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics industrial output rose in relative to below the rate suggested by leading and coincident it is worth mentioning that two thirds of the sectors surveyed by the ibge presented favorable signaling more diffusion in the industrial activity in the year through industrial output increased compared to the same period of and in cumulative twelve months through since seasonally adjusted industrial results have alternated positive and negative performances in industrial production remained at elevated historical the moving average declined in november for the third consecutive still reflecting the september leading and coincident indicators anticipate a positive performance for both in and moving average regarding disaggregated industrial output data for the main use categories presented unique reversing trends registered in capital goods production rose after falling in the previous while durable goods production fell compared to a increase in as for and consumer output increased moving averages were stable for capital and intermediate and fell for and consumer despite the weaker recent durable goods production expanded through the year and in a trailing well above the industrial sector and consumer goods production increased through the year and in a trailing reflecting the effects of real income growth in the the labor market sustained a positive in line with the more stable macroeconomic environment and the historically high levels of economic the unemployment rate measured by the ibge stood unchanged at in in comparison to november the unemployment rate declined while the number of employed individuals rose average real earnings rose relative to up if compared to november partially reflecting the positive effects of lower inflation on real according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment rose in the year through november and over twelve on the same real manufacturing payrolls increased and these indicators confirm the recent trend associating more jobs with higher formal employment measured by the ministry of labor and employment maintained its upward trajectory in accumulating million new considering this in more formal jobs were created than in the previous four ibge seasonally adjusted data for november showed a increase in retail sales relative to october and a increase relative to november sales that are more sensitive to income and employment posted positive counterbalancing the negative performance of more sales to what happened in the beginning of the recovery when sales led the moving average sales remained close to the record preliminary data for december suggest further the favorable outlook for retail sales in the coming months is supported by positive labor market credit and the recovery in consumer from the second quarter the expansionist effect of a higher minimum wage must also be installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry increased in as measured by the cni and seasonally adjusted by the after two declining the november upsurge took place in a period of maturing investment projects made in recent as emphasized in prior copom the future inflation trend remains directly linked to current and prospective developments regarding the expansion of to adequately meet demand in this capital goods absorption rose in the year through mainly driven by the increase in capital goods which rose in volume in the same even with increasing evidence of rising the performance of aggregate supply in the coming quarters remains a key concern with regard to future inflation recent data confirm that external trade performance in was notably better than in twelvemonth cumulative exports reached driven primarily by the growth in manufactured exports billion or of the total exports the cumulative trade balance reached with imports totaling exports rose while imports increased through the the relative participation of capital goods imports in total imports has to the detriment of raw materials and intermediate the favorable performance of the trade accounts brought the current account surplus to billion in or of although the contribution of external demand to the ongoing economic expansion has diminished somewhat in recent it remains positive and above that expected at the start of the expectations for international trade in remain international financial markets improved relative to the scenario considered in the december copom with indications that the monetary tightening cycle would be completed brazil risk premium registered new record lows since reflecting consistent improved noticeably strong trade together with adequate consolidated public sector primary continued accumulation of international reserves and a better pubic debt contributing to safeguard the domestic economy from adverse external in line with these brazil risk for the first time reached levels below at the beginning of despite uncertainties in the global such as concerns regarding ongoing inflation both in the and in the euro the copom continues to assign a low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial markets international oil after reaching record highs in fell sharply until reversing course since on the eve of the january copom oil prices remained volatile and registered the highest levels since beginning of given the increase in domestic fuel prices implemented in the copom maintains a scenario in which there is no change to domestic prices in international oil prices remain a risk factor to future potentially affecting the prices of as well as inflation assessment of inflation trends the inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following gasoline and bottled gas prices will not suffer any adjustment in as considered at the december issue of the inflation regarding fixed line telephone rate the projection for presented at the inflation was the projection for household electricity adjustments was also maintained in similar to the last inflation for all regulated and considering their composition change discussed in the december inflation the copom maintained the adjustment projection for these according to the weights released by the ibge in represent of the total the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on the endogenous determination remained at as presented in the last inflation this model considers the effects of seasonal of the exchange of market prices inflation and of the the projection for the spread over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the copom increased from an average of basis points in the first quarter of to basis points in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the december copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations rose from to despite the little recent market consensus seems to be in line with the inflation target established by the cmn for the as mentioned again and again in prior copom this fact suggests that the recent monetary policy stance has both contained inflationary pressures and contributed to the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic though below the inflation target for the the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period increased relative to the december copom reflecting the selic rate the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange rate and selic rate trajectories on the eve of the meeting also continuing above the for the benchmark forecast remained below the inflation but also increased compared to on the other the forecast under the market scenario remained above the inflation but decreased compared to december due to the lower exchange rate depreciation expected by market participants for the monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that current and expected inflation demonstrate that the monetary stance adopted since september has contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic economic activity data suggest the progressive consolidation of an upward trend at a pace consistent with supply such that it will not introduce significant inflationary in despite continued volatility in international financial markets and the persistence of high oil the external environment remains particularly with regard to the external financing conditions to a benign inflation environment continues to as in the december the committee emphasizes that the main challenge for monetary policy is to ensure the consolidation of these favorable the inflation upsurge in the beginning of captured by different price has been occurring with a higher intensity than originally the recent increase is partially due to specific seasonal which may impact the inflation in the first two months of the easing over time contaminating longer time the copom will continue to closely monitor the evolution of headline and core inflation in the coming distinguishing between and more generalized or persistent price and adapting its monetary stance to the the uninterrupted convergence of inflation to the target path and the resulting consolidation of a long lasting macroeconomic stability will contribute to the progressive reduction in perceived macroeconomic a process already underway for several the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally the copom considers that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the target for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation in this the gradual monetary easing will not compromise the important achievements made in reducing inflation and preserving economic growth with job creation and rising real considering the current the copom unanimously decided to continue the monetary easing process and reduce the selic rate target to without considering the uncertainties regarding the monetary transmission mechanisms and the risks associated to the scenarios established in different the committee considers that it will be necessary to closely follow the evolution of the inflation outlook until the next at which time it will define the next steps in its monetary policy at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on march for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca decelerated to in from in accumulating in the year in the lower pressure of transportation and food prices were the main drivers of the december market prices reached compared to in while regulated prices inflation decreased

economic activity point to the recovery of the brazilian at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment global outlook remains with risk appetite towards emerging economies at levels below those seen early this the main risks continue to be associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies and with uncertainty regarding global measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and expectations for remain around inflation projections in the scenario with selic and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at increases to over the course of and remains at that level until the end of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at at and at in this the inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for for and for in this the inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the september copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both but with greater weight on the last two listed on the one the high level of economic slack may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies the committee judges that the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks has diminished since its previous discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available they concluded that the data indicate continuation of the recovery of economic at a more gradual pace than envisaged early this regarding the global the committee members considered that it remains challenging for emerging they evaluated since their previous risk appetite for assets of these economies stabilized in contrast with the worsening trend observed in the previous the assessment was that this stabilization occurred at levels lower that those observed at the beginning of the which implies higher risk in since the previous copom prices of risky assets in some advanced economies have shown greater which contrasts with the favorable evolution observed the baseline scenario assumes gradual normalization of monetary policy in central the committee members also mentioned the risks to the continued expansion of international with possible impacts on global and on the chinese in in this the copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of payments and the environment value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central bank of copom anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic the members of the committee also highlighted the reduction of uncertainties in the domestic which led to a decline in risk premia embedded in brazilian asset this decline of uncertainties contributed to reduce the degree of asymmetry in the balance of risks for despite this the copom members concluded that upward risks to inflation continue to have a greater weight in the balance of the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory for the next this trajectory should lead to a rise of month reaching a peak around the second quarter of inflation is expected to decline over the remainder of towards the regard to underlying in recent months its various measures have risen from levels considered to be reaching levels that the committee deems appropriate generally consistent with the inflation recent changes in relative in a context of anchored inflation seem to have contributed to raise inflation to levels compatible with the inflation without posing risks to the maintenance of inflation at these levels once such relative price adjustments have taken the committee members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms along with the anchoring of inflation expectations should be monitored in order to evaluate possible more enduring effects from recent shocks to inflation their copom members then discussed the convenience of maintaining in their official documents the message on principles for conducting monetary policy in face of relative price shocks in an inflation targeting regime with anchored the copom has communicated in this monetary policy should focus only on possible effects of relative price changes induced by occasional it has also stressed that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be monetary policy will follow the same whether in face of inflationary shocks in the case of a shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange or in face of disinflationary shocks in the case of a favorable food price committee members pondered that it should already be clear that there is no mechanical relationship between shocks that produce relative price adjustments and monetary they agreed to exclude this message as of their next with the understanding that this should not be interpreted as a change in the conduct of monetary the members of the committee also discussed the extent of the exchange rate in the brazilian they assessed with the exception of some administered the level of has been the members that the intensity of depends on several such as the level of economic and the degree of anchoring of inflation the committee will continue to monitor different measures of exchange rate through to both inflation and underlying copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at adequate inflation projections close to the target for and and high level of slack in the economy still prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of the committee members expressed the view that the current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary all members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic conditions in on inflation the level of economic the balance of and inflation the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the committee assessed that this stimulus should be removed gradually if the prospective scenario for inflation at the relevant horizon its balance of risks copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its september meeting they unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary despite the reduction in the degree of asymmetry of the balance of all members considered that the current environment prescribes retaining greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary which requires refraining from providing indications of the next steps of monetary the members of the copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order central bank of copom maintain the path for prospective inflation in line with inflation this requires flexibility to gradually adjust the conduct of monetary policy when and if this ability to respond to different circumstances contributes to the maintenance of the environment with anchored which is fundamental to ensure that the achievement of low inflation even in face of adverse the committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to increase transparency and enhance in this they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of fiscal and adjustments in the brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the committee also notes that the perception of continuity in the of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic the copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and of the balance of and of economic shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible effects to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the it is through such effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and and change the balance of these effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored at the there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary copom reiterates that economic conditions still prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural this stimulus will begin to be removed gradually if the outlook for inflation at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy its balance of risks in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the selic rate at its current the

other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with a smaller copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the

regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached while inflation related to goods increased compared to and in specifically on inflation in this segment fell in december to after rising in but ended at a high in in the set of available information suggests a declining trend of inflation on a twelvemonth accumulated but some persistence of the high price hikes observed in which partially reflects the fact that services inflation remains at high underlying inflation measures calculated by the in performed similarly to the observed in headline with slight decrease in the average of monthly as well as in the average of twelvemonth inflation through december the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation moved from in october to in november and in while the trimmed

these five core measures changed from in october to in november and in the twelve months through the average change of the five core measures registered compared to in november and to in the general price index registered deflation in after increasing in november and in the decline in the index in december was driven by significant reduction in producer prices during the the accumulated inflation

civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed on its the industry price index calculated by the was unchanged in after increasing in in twelve this index changed from in october to in in the recent evolution of these indices indicates the reduction of the pressures stemming from wholesale prices over consumer the brazilian economy grew in the third quarter of compared to the same quarter last after growing in the first quarter and in the second according to the same comparison according to data seasonally adjusted by the gdp remained unchanged in the third after expanding by in the first and in the second the accumulated rate of growth in four quarters fell from to which confirms that the brazilian economy is in a cycle of growth that presents a pace more in line with rates assessed as sustainable in the long the moderation in the pace of growth was noticeable in all components of domestic and in from the policy actions implemented since the end of intensified by the deterioration of the global economic scenario since the third quarter of last the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the increased by in after contractions of in october and in the rate of

the indicators of credit built based on consultation carried out quarterly by the bcb with financial institutions representing every segment of the credit in more restrictive conditions for the quarter from january to march regarding credit for large the analysis suggests more restrictive for small and medium the indicators show a scenario similar to the observed in the previous with supply moderately more restrictive and demand moderately but at levels below those observed the third quarter of regarding credit to the outlook for this quarter basically points to stability in the percentage of credit for housing despite the more selective supply by the financial the expectation of increasing demand induces a scenario with the approval of new in this moderately above than the figures observed in the previous industrial activity increased by in according to data seasonally adjusted by the after falling in october and in production increased in of the branches of activity in with the greatest expansion occurring in the machinery and equipment sector according to the quarterly moving industrial production declined between september and after falling in the period between august and production decreased in while on a accumulated it expanded by compared to december month with the lowest output level during the the accumulated growth until september reached according to data from the national industry confederation earnings in the manufacturing industry recorded real growth in while the number of hours worked decreased among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in november there were increases of in the production of capital in the production of intermediate goods and in the production of and consumer the production of durable consumer goods declined in twelve months through intermediate goods output increased while the production of durable consumer goods and and consumer goods output fell by and according to the same comparison capital goods industry recorded the highest growth activity level among use expanding by reflecting the dynamism of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed reached in compared to registered in november after reaching in after recording in march the observed unemployment rate reduced significantly and reached a record low in since the start of the series in march the unemployment rate seasonally adjusted by the bcb decreased from in october to in at the same the occupation level followed upward trend observed over the last years and reached new record high in november data released by the ministry of labor and employment indicate slowdown in the creation of new in thousand formal jobs were created to thousand jobs created in november expanding the number of formal jobs in four of the eight sectors of economic services and trade were the sectors that mostly contributed for formal employment increase in the according to real average earnings remained stable in growing by in twelve as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in in evidences indicate that although the labor market remains there are signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey from expanded retail sales increased in after recording growth in october and in according to the same comparison according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales increased by in after a fall of in october and increase of in as a the accumulated growth rate reached in down from in october and in according to this comparison the volume of sales in all ten sectors surveyed with highlights for equipment and supplies for computer and communication and furniture and appliances since the in partnership with the bcb has also the trade confidence index this indicator provides important additional as it portrays the current state and signals the evolution of commercial activity in a more timely the index continued to indicate slowdown in the sector in similarly to what occurred in the two previous in the upcoming the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll by the consumer confidence level and by moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal moved from in november to in capacity utilization stood and lower than the levels observed in november and december according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the the nuci stood at in reaching below the record high recorded in june capacity utilization is higher in the sectors of construction inputs and intermediate goods in the sector of capital the nuci stood at while in the sector of consumer it stood at according to the confederation of national industry seasonally adjusted by the the nuci stood at in close to the percentage observed in october the rates of installed capacity utilization have been in the reduction in the pace of production growth and the maturity of in the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through november until while the production of construction inputs increased until the trade balance surplus on a accumulated basis decreased from billion in november to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the last twelve months through the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months increased from billion in october to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding the needs for external global economy continues to face a period of uncertainty above the with deterioration in activity prospects and the possibility of occurrence of extreme since the last specific signs of improvement in the united states advances in european fiscal governance and provision of liquidity by the european central bank were partly offset by stronger signs of deterioration in some mature the risks to global financial stability remain among due to exposure of international banks to sovereign debt of countries with fiscal and high levels of risk aversion despite a slight decrease at the from another high persistent unemployment coupled with the need for fiscal as well as limited scope for monetary policy actions and political have contributed for the reduction of growth projections in mature countries or even of their potential indicating wider and more volatile economic in the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for reinforced the signs of activity inflection in all main with less favorable prospects for this and the upcoming in specific the probability of recession especially in the euro disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for related to activity in industry and in the services sector in consistent with this despite the improvement at the margin in there has also been continued reduction in growth projections for important emerging regarding monetary mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances in specific monetary policy regarding the core measures have persisted at moderate levels in the us and in the euro in emerging in monetary policy bias is the price of brent oil barrel has shown but remained above this price level is consistent with a scenario of moderation in global combined with higher political instability in some producer countries and with lags in the process of production it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the swing in agricultural with small reduction when measured by the commodity research bureau and slight elevation in the prices of the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers accumulates a fall of until since the peak observed in february in the recent the high volatility observed in the prices of commodities was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of growth and to volatility in fx of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline and bottled gas for remained at the same value considered at the november the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and for were maintained at and the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark was maintained at the same value considered at the november the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark increased to up from the value considered at the november copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target around of without in a primary surplus of around of gdp is considered for without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the change in the ipca weighting which will take place in january the projections were developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that identify in a broader manner the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the brazilian economy among imports prices and external volatility as a working the main scenario considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased from to for the median of inflation expectations stands at specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians of expectations for the ipca changed from and to and for the medians stand at and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the november copom and it stands around the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for remained relatively above the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection stands around the midpoint of the target in the benchmark scenario and in the market policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since the last the risks to global financial stability have remained high and the process of deterioration of the international scenario has already at that faced generalized and significant reduction in growth projections for the main economic the committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain it also notes in these there seems to be limited scope for using monetary and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in for the main emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external through the external trade the committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among the reduction of total the moderation in investment tighter credit conditions and the worsening in consumer and businessmen the committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment add up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic which is for in the retreat of growth projections for the brazilian economy this year and in the upcoming in other the moderation process of the brazilian economy was intensified by the weakness of the global the copom evaluates although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is prospects for economic activity are this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that notwithstanding the accommodation at the stands at historically high the copom that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve which started to retreat in the last tends to continue the decline to move towards the targets the committee evaluates by the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the expectations of economic especially those of the price about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming the committee believes that this improvement in the perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity both domestic and in this and in the upcoming the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the trend of the public ratio the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderation in credit market still about the credit the committee considers opportune the adoption of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has retreated and is below the that it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the committee also observes in commodities prices in international markets have shown benign in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level and evaluates that since the last the inflation prospective scenario has accumulated favorable the copom notes according to the main the inflation rate stands around the target in and identifies decreasing risks to the materialization of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom unanimously decided to decrease the selic target to without the copom evaluates that domestic demand is still especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of the monetary policy actions recently in are lagged and on the other the committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the substantial and persistent deterioration in the international these elements and the quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that the brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in the interest rates in in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed for the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral which are according to the permanent in light of the above and also considering that the deceleration of the brazilian economy in the second semester of last year was deeper than and that recent events indicate postponement of a definitive solution for the european financial at the present the copom attributes high probability for the materialization of a scenario that considers the decrease of the selic target to at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on march for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in down from in according to data released by the the monthly result reflected slight acceleration of market prices and deceleration in regulated regarding market which increased in compared to in the movement was influenced by the increase in the prices of which grew in up from in while the prices of tradable goods increased down from in the previous among the prices of it bears highlighting the deceleration in the prices of which increased down from in the previous regulated prices rose in down from in with emphasis on the retreat in the prices of flying which grew in down from in the previous the ipca monthly change mainly reflected the increase acceleration increase in the prices of food and which contributed in the up from in the diffusion index stood at in down from in in the index average reached up from in the previous in the ipca

regulated prices were urban bus in up from in gasoline in up from in health insurance in up from in and flying tickets in up from in on a trailing in market prices and regulated prices decelerated relative to when they had recorded respective increases of and the evolution of market prices was due to the deceleration in the prices of tradable from in november to in while the prices of goods accelerated from to the prices of the services sector increased in the last twelve months through compared to and in the same periods in october and the totaled in down from in according to reflecting

through down from in the twelve months through the remained stable in compared to in increasing in the year and in the period ended in november in the previous the monthly result was mainly driven by the increases related to oil and and automobile shells and with contributions of in each offset by the negative contributions of stemming from the prices of food products and from the prices of paper

beige book reports modest to moderate growth in twelve these views are endorsed by better despite for the labor market and consumer the purchasing index of manufacturing industry reached points in the highest level in six the balance of risks for the us economy remains among by the end of fiscal stimuli this with only partial expectation of by the weak housing the slow recovery of the labor and by the fact that an important part of the recent increase in consumption is due to the reduction in in the euro industrial in fell for the third consecutive and the manufacturing pmi figure for suggests the continuation of this household and businessmen confidence remains in low influenced by the worsening of the sovereign debt in economic activity is reflecting the global economic slowdown and the appreciation of the the regional economic published by the central bank of that in pause in economic activity in seven of the nine the industrial output resumed retreat in also influenced by the interruption in the supply of parts for automobiles and computers caused by the floods in in despite the risks stemming from the external scenario and those related to the housing economic activity remains picking despite gdp grew in the fourth quarter from in the third both compared to same periods last on a quarterly seasonally the chinese gdp growth slowed to from the previous the monthly data of industrial production and retail sales accelerated from and in november to respectively and in stock markets have shown some recovery since the last monetary policy committee as a result of scenario slightly less uncertain regarding the trajectory of the us the possibility of broad agreement in europe towards fiscal targets and also the injection of billion in loans for banks in the euro the banks remain preferring to use the overnight deposit which for several days hit record surpassing the market for sovereign debt in the euro area remained depressed due to the unfavorable outlook for economic activity in the block and the uncertainty relative to the compliance with fiscal targets in some some reduction in the premiums charged in the most recent sovereign on january a risk rating agency announced the downgrade of the credit rating in nine countries of the euro including and later the credit of the european financial stability facility commodities international prices showed two markedly different trends since the last monetary policy committee ending the period at levels close to those seen on that until the intensification of risk aversion in financial markets and the continuous improvement in supply conditions in agricultural commodities markets favored the devaluation of these since commodities prices reversed the influenced by bad weather in south in the case of by geopolitical relative to in general by the disclosure of economic indicators in major world economies and by the consequent reduction of risk aversion in financial the annual change in consumer price index fell in the in and in the euro area and in the uk in and compared to and recorded two months in after three consecutive months of just moderately positive deflation returned as of with the annual change in cpi reaching in among emerging it bears highlighting the significant disinflation process in china during the second half of with the annual change in cpi falling to in from in considering the context of inflation and growth the accommodative stance of monetary policy prevailed among central the official interest rates in developed economies remained at exceptionally low with the ecb promoting two successive cuts of basis points in its base rate in november and when it stood at at the january the ecb endorsed the there was a reduction in basic interest rates by central banks of chile all basis and norway basis while colombia and hungary raised their rates by basis points and basis trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in exports reached billion and in the the trade surplus totaled above the registered in reflecting expansions of in exports and in in the total trade grew totaling compared to billion in international reserves reached billion in decreasing million compared to compared to december the reserves increased in there were no monetary interventions in the domestic spot market and open market operations since the last copom in the domestic interest rate yield curve increased the with decline in rates and increase in rates longer than six the movement of the short part mainly reflected the prospect of continuing the monetary easing cycle and improving the expected scenario for in the long the increase in the rates was mainly by economic stimulus measures announced by the government and by the expected recovery of economic regarding the external the release of economic indicators considered positive in some particularly in the and the recovery in commodities prices also contributed to the rise in between november and january the and interest rates fell by and the rates for maturities of two and three years increased by and the real interest as measured by the ratio between the nominal rate of one year and expected inflation for the next twelve increased from on november to on january the rise in nominal in its open market the bcb carried out between november and january repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations decreased to in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between eleven and working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through and donated through one very and carried out leveling operations conducted at the end of the with tenures of two working the average daily balance of these operations totaled billion in the the average daily balance of the total outstanding of repurchase agreements of the central bank increased from between october and november to between november and january considering the operations for the most recent the total outstanding of repurchase agreements increased from on november to on january the main factor that contributed to the expansion of liquidity in the period was the net redemption of securities by the national between november and january the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and the sales of lfts totaled for securities maturing in the sales of reached for securities maturing in and after decelerating for three consecutive ipca inflation reached in this result was slightly above market expectations on the eve of the disclosure of the but well below expectations at the end of in the year through ipca inflation totaled roughly the half of the result observed in the same period of last year trailing inflation reduced to in july down from in the lowest level for the series since june when the inflation target regime was the inflation increase in july was mainly driven by the increase in both market such as household workers costs and perishable food prices and in regulated such as bus a benign inflation scenario continues to evolve in line with the targets with favorable prospects for inflation in the coming the acceleration of headline inflation in july was reflected in all ipca core inflation core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased to in up from deflation in the previous two smoothed trimmed means core remained stable relative to reflecting the implicit inertial on the other trimmed means core increased in up from the three core measures continue to be in line with the targets on a trailing the core inflation by exclusion and the core inflation stood below the center of the similarly to the headline on the other the smoothed core inflation has converged more slowly to the reaching in the last twelve months ended in down from in the last twelve months ended in in contrast with consumer price the general price index decelerated to in up from in for a increase in the year through compared to in the same period of last in the twelve months through the increased compared to in the twelve months through the fall in july was mainly driven by accommodation in wholesale price inflation and in construction after presenting deflation in the period ended in the increased to in may and in reducing to in the most important drivers of the july result were the fall in agricultural prices in july down from in and in industrial prices from in the same even after rising in the the agricultural ipa accumulated a decrease in the twelve months through on the other the industrial ipa increased in the twelve months through up from in wholesale price inflation may continue to positively influence consumer price inflation in the coming despite the elevated prices of some important international as emphasized in recent copom the continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation industrial output recorded in on a seasonally adjusted down from in according to data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics on a moving average industrial output slightly decreased in virtually unchanged relative to the record high registered in industrial production fell by in compared to the same month last after a increase in according to the same comparison in the first half of the industrial output expanded by compared to the same period last while industrial production reached down from in april and it bears emphasizing that the industrial output result in june demands cautious interpretation due to the influence of in leading and coincident indicators suggest industrial output expansion in in both seasonally adjusted terms and on a moving average despite june this contraction should not interrupt the gradual industrial output process expected in previous particularly in light of the negative events in of the release of the first leading results for july and of the several incentive such as the monetary easing implemented since september disaggregated industrial data in june shows that intermediate goods and capital goods production decreased by and while durable consumer goods production grew compared to the same month last on a seasonally adjusted intermediate goods output decreased almost in after expanding at a vigorous pace in in the year through the main drivers of industrial growth have been durable consumer goods production and capital goods production the expansion of durable goods production among other the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of the expansion of capital goods production is due to positive prospects for domestic and also to the influence of favorable international prices for some industrial in line with the last fgv which revealed that of the participants are likely to invest more in than they did in the previous the unemployment rate increased to in july from in as against the reached in the same month last the average unemployment rate in the year through july was virtually unchanged compared to the same period last notwithstanding the increase in labor force in compared to the same month last that result reflects that employed people grew according to the same comparison indicating that the pace of jobs creation remains the purchase power of workers decreased a in despite the increase in july relative to the same month last and in the year through july relative to the same period last as a real payrolls increased according to the same comparison according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment decreased a seasonally adjusted in after four consecutive months of but expanded compared to the same month last according to this comparison manufacturing employment has grown consecutive in the last twelve the expansion totaled according to the ministry of labor and employment formal employment grew a seasonally adjusted in confirming the continuity of the ongoing in the twelve months through it increased by mainly driven by the expansions of in civil construction and in the retail with the creation of jobs in july million in the last twelve formal job creation increased to ibge seasonally adjusted data recorded a seasonally adjusted decrease in retail sales for this was the first decrease after three consecutive months of retail sales increased in june and in compared to the same months of sales expanded by in the first half of the compared to the same period last and in the last twelve in the seasonally adjusted sales in three out of four retail categories only beverages and tobacco sales reflecting strengthening of the labor despite the decrease in retail sales have outperformed industrial output and reflect favorable demand retail sales expansion is expected to continue in the coming fostered by positive labor market and income credit expansion and the monetary easing as well as by the recovery in consumer confidence and the expansionary impacts of the minimum wage installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry increased for the second consecutive to in june up from in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the in the first half of the the average installed capacity utilization stood below the levels registered in the same period of although this difference has marginally this decline partially reflects the improvements in the productive in recent data regarding absorption of capital goods and civil construction inputs suggest the expansion of for in the year through the absorption of capital goods expanded by compared to the same period of the main drivers of this result were the increases in capital goods imports volume and in capital goods production civil construction inputs expanded by according to the same comparison despite favorable prospects for aggregate demand relevant supply unbalances are not anticipated in the coming as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust results in confirming previous copom assessments regarding important structural changes in the brazilian external in the year through trade balance reached above the level reached in the same period last trailing surplus through july reached above the previous but slightly below the billion record high reached in despite trade surpluses remain at elevated this process was already expected and suggests the start of a new adjustment dynamics for the trade even trailing exports through july reached a new record high for the imports have also continued to reaching a new record in according to the same comparison as a robust external results are expected in and the current account surplus stood at billion in a record high for the for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of regarding the international it bears emphasizing the interruption in the monetary policy tightening cycle in the after seventeen consecutive interest rate despite the fact that additional increases cannot be the uncertainties regarding the monetary policy stance in the us are much on the other concerns about the long monetary tightening cycle increased the fear of a recession in the us the deterioration of the international scenario in the last especially with regard to higher risk aversion and lower international had limited influence in after an in the sovereign risk reached historically low levels in the last this fact corroborates recurrent expressed in previous press releases and inflation that the brazilian economy is more resilient to external in this the copom reaffirms that the continued robust and persistent trade accumulation of international adequate public primary improved public debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to external the in domestic resilience to shocks reflected the evidence that the domestic economy has sustained the growth trend despite the long monetary adjustment process in course in the euro zone and the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external another concern regarding the international scenario is the oil despite the decline observed since the last copom oil prices remain at elevated standing above the level observed at the end of in oil prices still present high reflecting geopolitical the current scenario might reflect structural unbalances in the oil oil prices might not face a temporary but may resist at elevated levels longer than previously as in previous the future oil prices trajectory still encompasses great and a significant downturn in prices seems less likely to occur in the short as mentioned in last copom the scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in has become less likely to and the risks related to its materialization have increased shall the trends recently observed the copom may have to incorporate in the benchmark scenario an increase in domestic oil prices in in apart from the effects of an increase in domestic fuel the elevation in international oil prices affects the domestic economy through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of market inflation assessment of inflation trends the inflation shocks ands their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the july copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in remained in and considering the same comparison the projections for fixed line telephone and household electricity adjustments in remained in and the copom maintained the adjustment projection for all regulated prices in these according to the weights released by the represent of the total july according to the endogenous determination the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to from this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the third quarter of reaching in the last quarter of and in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the july copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group decreased to from the ahead inflation expectations increased to from for inflation expectations remained in line with the target established by the as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period remained almost stable compared to the values considered at the july copom below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting also remained almost stable relative to the values considered in the july copom below the target for the the projections for according to both also remained relatively stable compared to the july below the target in the benchmark scenario and above the target in the market monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that monetary policy has both contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic the economic activity data still suggest expansion in line with the supply conditions in the next with low likelihood of significant pressure over despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international due to the interest rates increase in industrialized and to oil prices swings at historically high the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external even taking into account that part of the favorable results for the inflation tends to revert in the the scenario for the inflation trajectory remains as in the july the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of anticipated favorable the uninterrupted convergence of inflation to the targets path and the resulting consolidation of a durable macroeconomic stability will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this perception the copom evaluates that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation the copom emphasizes that there are important lags in monetary policy transmission to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has been reduced by with the greater part of the reduction concentrated in the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the recent activity resumption on inflation have not completely during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in the july copom activity level should also reflect the effects of the new minimum wage and the fiscal impulse occurred since the last quarter of and expected for the rest of the effects of interest rates cuts will add up to other factors that will contribute to demand given the reasons stated the copom considered the convenience to reduce the selic rate by basis despite considering that several factors would justify such the copom members concluded at the present a basis points reduction in the selic rate would be a better response of the current monetary conditions to the improved inflation outlook observed between the july and august in light of this the copom unanimously decided to continue the monetary policy easing process begun in the september meeting and reduce the selic rate target to without and follow the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until the next at which time it will define the next steps in its monetary policy given the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission mechanisms and the lower distance between the current selic rate and the interest the copom understood that the maintenance of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real may demand a more cautious monetary easing this argument is even more relevant in light of the fact that the monetary policy decisions in the coming months will produce concentrated impacts for under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price despite the decrease in international financial markets some factors that caused heightened volatility in may still in such an the monetary authority must remain vigilant so that uncertainties do not contaminate time in case of an exacerbation of the risk factors monitored by the the monetary policy strategy will be promptly adapted to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on october for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased in up from in three out of the nine surveyed groups presented negative clothing communication and housing personal outlays health and personal care and transportation were the main group drivers of the july the prices of food and beverages increased in the after five consecutive monthly mainly due to the elevation in the prices of fruit and the main individual drivers of ipca inflation in july were bus fares and household which contributed and the ipca rose by in the year through july and in the last twelve regulated prices grew in july and in the last twelve while market prices increased by and in the same amongst market prices of tradable goods remained stable in while the prices of goods rose on a trailing tradable and prices increased ad the increased in for cumulative changes of in the year through july and in twelve the ipa prices the with the largest weight in the decelerated in increasing down from in for cumulative changes of in the year through july and in twelve the grew in the after recording in reflecting the upturn in food prices in july up from in the previous the incc also decelerated in increasing by down from in reflecting the reduced impact of wage the deceleration in wholesale price inflation in july was driven by lower changes in both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached down from in reflecting the fall in the prices of beans and sugar which outweighed the increases in the prices of fruit and industrial prices showed an average increase of in down from in mainly due to the fall in the prices of according to the processing stages of only final goods showed price increasing up from in the prices of intermediate goods declined while the prices of raw materials increased after posting and in all ipca core inflation measures sustained their declining trend on a the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at in totaling in twelve compared to in the trimmed means core reached in decreasing to in twelve down from in the core excluding household food and monitored prices rose by reaching in the last twelve down from in the previous the core calculated by the fgv under the symmetric trimmed means reached totaling in the year through july and in the last twelve the ipca diffusion index the number of items in the ipca registering price stood at in up from in the partial results of consumer price indices confirm favorable expectations for the august despite the upturn in food especially rice and perishable at the wholesale the increase in the prices of legumes and fruit in the agricultural and of machinery and fuel and among industrial were the main drivers of the ipa acceleration in partial august economic activity economic activity indicators showed unfavorable results in contrasting with the expansive trend observed in the last these results were greatly influenced by punctual factors in the such as the soccer world scheduled inactivity in petrobras platforms and the strike at the federal revenue and customs which restricted imports of those factors negatively influenced production indicators to a lower also affected demand performance in the according to monthly retail sales decreased a seasonally adjusted in after growing for three consecutive only and supermarket food beverages and tobacco expanded on a basis in the first half of the retail sales rose by compared to the same period of with highlights to the increases observed in furniture and home appliances and and supermarkets food products and beverages reflecting credit expansion and real earnings são paulo trade association seasonally adjusted by banco central do presented different behavior in consultations to the usecheque system increased while database consultations for credit sales declined by in the year through those indicators expanded by and compared to the same period of regarding investment both capital goods and civil construction inputs production showed seasonally adjusted reductions of and in capital goods imports increased seasonally according to the volume index calculated by the in the first half of the these indicators rose by and compared to the same period of capital goods production for energy increased for for mixed while capital goods production for agriculture fell in the same for industrial serialized production of equipment decreased while production increased by in the same according to the monthly industrial survey industrial production recorded a seasonally adjusted in mining decreased mainly driven by the scheduled inactivity in seven petrobras while manufacturing industry fell by according to the same comparison in the first half of industrial production reached compared to the same period of mainly driven by the expansions of in manufacturing industry and in all use categories fell in on a seasonally adjusted intermediate goods and capital goods production decreased by and while durable consumer goods and and goods production fell by and in the first half of the compared to the same period of all categories with highlights to durable goods production and capital goods production seasonally adjusted data for industrial production showed that of the sectors surveyed decreased in the main drivers of the result were the fall in the production of other chemical mining machinery and other transportation equipment and electronic material and communication pharmaceutical refined oil and alcohol production recorded monthly automobile production grew a seasonally adjusted in for a growth in the year through compared to the same period of domestic and external sales increased and in in the year through domestic sales increased while external sales decreased compared to the same period of the previous other indicators referring to industrial performance in july pointed to a recovery in such as the positive monthly changes related to highway tolls own electric charge steel production and corrugated cardboard considering seasonally adjusted and expectations the survey showed a decrease in consumer confidence in reaching a record low for the last nine but a expansion relative to the same month of the two components of the icc declined in the current economic conditions decreased while captured by the consumer expectation index decreased by according to the the iec increased a in and compared to the same month of according to the fgv which encompassed homes in the seven main capitals of the the icc increased in compared to the previous recording improvements of in the present situation assessment and in the ahead still according to industrial activity current outlook is similar to that observed in july with prospects of measured industrial inventory levels are considered average industrial capacity utilization reached a record high for this time of the year since the forecasts for the coming months are more optimistic in with highlights to the improvement in the industrial employment and business overall the survey revealed that of companies intend to raise compared to in while of companies intend to

inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through april in april the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in april partially driven by pressures stemming from labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions

of the regarding the global leading indicators in the horizon relevant for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced in the emerging they stand at relatively high the price of the brent oil barrel remained around since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural have risen while metal commodities prices have fallen on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through april assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the april copom among other this projection considers the assumption of changes of in the price of in the price of bottled in fixed telephone tariffs and of in electricity the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at billion for and of the gdp for it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the april meeting and remains above the inflation for according to both the baseline and the market the inflation forecast remained stable and above the inflation target set by the monetary policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains with possible episodes of higher for the a more intense global activity trend prevails throughout the monetary policy relevant in this the prospects indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition and of moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights evidence of volatility sources in the currency and fixed income markets and moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom reaffirms that the available indicators regarding domestic absorption and gdp growth rates have converged and that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the in the investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of and private consumption shows moderation for the after a necessary period of the activity expansion pace tends to as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth more favorable to potential growth in the regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal the committee considers during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections will contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also highlights that this primary path will strengthen the perception of sustainability of the public sector it contributes to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in stimulating private investment in the medium and long specifically regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which is already being important to highlight the fact after years of strong the consumer credit has so over the last it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by the recently implemented the committee considers as necessary the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the as anticipated by previous the copom highlights that the narrow idleness margin in the labor market has with some data confirming the start of a process of distension in this the copom notices that it is necessary to broaden the horizon of and that a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of wage increases incompatible with productivity with negative impacts over in spite of not so significant adjustments for the minimum and the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers since its last these relative prices ajustments in the among other have made the balance of risks to inflation unfavorable this in this and as anticipated in previous due to these price adjustments inflation rises in the short term and tend to remain high in requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts on the committee reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects stemming from in order to limit them to given the assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic rate by to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson otávio ribeiro sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to due to factors such as income and on the other the real state the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the for the the combined effects of these and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market this the recovery dynamics of regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by at the end of the copom believes that the convergence scenario of inflation to at the end of has for the the progress made in the fight against inflation like benign signals stemming from the medium and long term expectations indicators has not been sufficient in this the copom reaffirms that the monetary policy should remain at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on july for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index rose to in july in as a trailing inflation reached compared to in july market prices changed in the twelve months through july in july and regulated in july among market the prices of tradable goods increased in the twelve months through july in july and the prices of in july the prices of food and beverages impacted by domestic and external by in july in july and reached in twelve the prices of services rose in july in and in twelve months in july in services inflation still remains at high levels and there are localized pressures in the food and beverages underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb have performed similarly to headline the average of monthly changes moved from in june to in on its on a trailing the average change of the five core inflation measures moved from in june to in the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation moved from in june to in and the trimmed means core inflation changed from to in the same the double weight core after registering in registered in at the same core inflation by which excludes ten household food and fuels increased from in june to in and the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household food changed from in june to in the general price index increased from in june to in on a trailing in in july the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in the twelve months through influenced by the agricultural sector impacted by supply according to the breakdown by stage of there were increases in the prices of raw materials intermediate goods and final goods according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the stood at in the twelve months through july in july the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed driven by the increase in labor on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in june in and in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the increased by in after registering stability in as a the indicator increased in the second and increased the accumulated growth rate reached in on its the consumer confidence index from getúlio vargas foundation retreated for the fourth consecutive month in after in the record high for the series started in september on its the services sector confidence index presented the fifth consecutive decline in july and points to moderation of the activity in the industrial activity registered positive growth in june after three months of according to the series seasonally adjusted by the industrial production rose in after falling in production grew in twelve of the branches of industrial production fell in june and on a accumulated as a production in the first semester stood below the production in the first semester of regarding revenues in the manufacturing there was real growth of in the first according to the same comparison despite a decline in the number of hours according to the national confederation of industry among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of durable consumer goods grew in the highest level in six the production of and nondurable consumer and of capital expanded by and in while the production of intermediate goods decreased by regarding the accumulated growth through there were decreases in the production of durable consumer goods and consumer goods capital goods and intermediate goods the ibge released the july unemployment rate for four of the six metropolitan areas covered by the monthly employment survey on a the survey indicated some stability in the rates in belo porto alegre and which registered and and a sharp drop in the metropolitan region of são where the unemployment rate decreased from in june to in compared to july the unemployment rate fell by percentage points in belo in porto alegre and in sao while in recife there was an increase of data released by the ministry of labour and employment show in thousand formal jobs were created thousand in july the sectors that contributed the most to this increase in the number of formal jobs in the in absolute were the services and the civil construction also according to the the average real income in july fell significantly in belo recife and são and remained stable in porto in the set of available data indicates although the labor market remains there are signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey from broad retail sales increased in in by fiscal according to the seasonally adjusted broad retail sales increased in after stability in the accumulated growth rate in twelve months stood at in with expansion in all ten sectors with highlights for computer and communication material and equipment and furniture and appliances since october the in partnership with the has been releasing the trade confidence index this indicator provides important additional as it portrays the current outlook and signals the evolution of commercial activity in a more timely in the index after remaining stable in for the upcoming the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll by the reduction in borrowing costs and by moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal rose in august standing above the level observed in august according to the seasonally adjusted series calculated by the the nuci stood at in also above the level recorded in august and below the record high of the series recorded in june capacity utilization intensified in the consumer goods which reached and also recovered in the capital goods which recorded in the sector of intermediate goods and construction the levels stood at and also according to the the industry confidence index continued a gradual recovery reaching the highest level since july according to the seasonally adjusted due to improvements in perceptions of both the current situation and the share of companies that reported inventories at normal levels increased since the last copom the trade balance surplus on a accumulated basis continued a downward dropping to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in associated to changes of and compared to the previous twelve as a the current account deficit in the same period increased from billion in june to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment totaled billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of surpassing the need for external global economy faces a period of with prospects of low growth for a prolonged in this a moderate pace of activity in the united states in an environment of risks deriving from the fiscal restraint outlook and from the european high unemployment rates for a long coupled with the implementation of fiscal the limited space for countercyclical actions and political uncertainties are translated into projections of low growth for mature the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to indicates moderate growth or strong slowdown in the main in the same the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for july suggest moderate global with slowdown in manufacturing regarding monetary advanced economies persist with strongly accommodative which can eventually be deepened core inflation measures have remained at moderate levels in the in the euro area and in in emerging in the monetary policy bias is which in some with additional countercyclical the price of brent oil barrel has increased since the last copom meeting and breached it bears highlighting that the even higher geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom international prices of metallic and agricultural commodities have increased and relative to the record highs observed in april the changes reach and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a fall of until compared to the peak recorded in february in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was influenced by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in fx it is plausible to affirm that the reduction of growth targets in coupled with the fragility of the global tends to generate downward pressures over commodities prices in the medium of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas for were maintained at the same value considered at the july copom the projected adjustments for for fixed telephone and for electricity were maintained at and unchanged relative to the july the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was maintained at considered at the july copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the july copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus around of without it is as a working a primary surplus around of gdp for without according to parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for it is as a working a primary surplus of of without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last the main scenario does not include the occurrence of extreme events in international financial but considers the estimates of the impacts caused by changes in the external environment on the brazilian in it incorporates the estimated effect of the recent supply shock in agricultural since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations was maintained at specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed to and from and for the median changed to and from and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the july copom meeting and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for increased and it stands above the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection remained stable in both above the midpoint target also in both for the first half of the inflation forecast is above the midpoint inflation target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investments and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those deriving from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic the committee understands the prospects of moderate global activity have remained and the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed it also notes in these there seems to be limited leeway for monetary policy and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming in important emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity remained on the other since the last there were evidences of localized pricing stemming from an unfavorable supply shock in agricultural for the this shock tends to be less intense and less lasting than the one observed in as well as it tends to reverse in the medium despite manifesting inflationary bias in the short the international scenario looks disinflationary in the medium for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among moderation of total moderation in investment flows and tighter credit another transmission channel of great importance is the impact over businessmen the copom evaluates although domestic demand expansion has prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are with some asymmetry among the several assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the fact that to a lesser confidence stands at high the committee that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve which started to retreat in the last quarter of tends to move towards the targets the committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic especially price about the inflation dynamics in this and in the upcoming the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the committee also highlights risks stemming from the instability in the prices of in natura products and which for in the dynamics of wholesale the committee considers that the recovery in domestic economic activity has materialized on the other it highlights that the main scenario encompasses more intense pace of activity in this semester and next the committee identifies decrease in the probability of extreme events in international financial at the same it argues that the external environment remains given the lack of a final solution for the european financial and the risks associated to the ongoing deleveraging process of households and government in the main economic since the last committee although the inflation prospective scenario has been negatively impacted by supply shocks related to domestic and foreign climatic events in the short it maintained favorable signs for longer the committee also notes according to the main scenario inflation tends to move towards the target in this the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and for the these the programs of public services concession and the gradual recovery of confidence create good prospects for investment in this and in the upcoming the committee considers that recent initiatives indicate scenario of neutrality of the public sector the committee also that the fragile international scenario represents as an important factor restraining aggregate these elements and quasi fiscal developments are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that the brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in the interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its

yield curve increased its with retreat in the rates and increase in the rates above one the movement in the short part of the curve the prospect of continuity in the fall of the selic rate and the uncertainties related to the pace of recovery in domestic economic in the long the increase in the rates was at the domestic by the release of several current inflation indices above the expected and by the increase of inflation at the external the increase in the prices of agricultural commodities and the expectation of announcement of the new monetary stimuli measures by the fed also contributed for the elevation of the between july and august the and interest rates fell by and the rates for maturities of two and three years increased by and the real interest as measured by the ratio between the nominal rate of one year and expected inflation for the next twelve slightly decreased from on july to on august mainly due to the increase in the ipca on august the bcb carried out reverse fx

in and accumulates change of in the twelve months through april in the twelve months through april the main component of this the wholesale price index changed until april according to the breakdown by stage of there were increases in the prices of raw materials intermediate goods and final goods according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the stood at in twelve months through april in the twelve months through april the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in the period in the twelve months through april partially driven by the increase in labor on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in expanding by in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the increased in after decreasing by in the economy grew in february and in with trailing growth remaining stable at the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation retreated in confirming the accommodation signaled in considering seasonally adjusted on its the services sector confidence index fell in similar to what had occurred in the industrial businessmen measured by the industry confidence index increased in due to the improvement in the perception of the current regarding the agricultural

idleness margin in the labor despite some signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the retail sales volume increased in broad retail sales volume increased according to the same comparison according to the seasonally adjusted in march retail sales changed by and broad retail by the broad retail sales growth rate in the last twelve months stood at with

from billion in exports and billion in associated to changes of and compared to the previous twelve on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of while the foreign direct investment totaled billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the in the global low growth prospects for a long period in important advanced economies notably in the euro and indicators of volatility and risk aversion have shown some high unemployment rates in coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political translated into declines in investment and low growth the composite leading released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to signaled improved outlook for growth in some advanced particularly in the united states and in on its the indicators of the purchasing managers index for indicate continued global despite at a more moderate both in the manufacturing and in the services regarding monetary the advanced economies have persisted with strongly accommodative coupled in some unconventional monetary policty in emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and negative in the price of brent oil barrel has oscillated since the previous copom reaching levels close to it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment the international prices of metallic and agricultural commodities have remained stable since the last copom on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a change of in the twelve months through april assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price in was maintained at unchanged relative to the april copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly unchanged relative to the april copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions recently as well as readjustments and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this for bottled gas prices are projected to remain stable and the fixed telephone tariff is projected to decrease the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in reduced to down from considered in the april copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the april copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus of according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for as a working a primary surplus of billion is according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law project the set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of the inflation expectations increased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the april copom meeting and stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast increased and stands above the midpoint inflation for the inflation forecast little changed relative to the figure considered at the copom meeting and stands above the midpoint inflation both in the baseline and in the market policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom understands that there were significant structural changes in the brazilian which determined retreat in interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction in risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the ninth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public for the all these transformations are characterized by high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding according to the are largely permanent have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic in this despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity with trend of intensification over the relevant horizon for monetary in this there are localized improvements in advanced although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has supported by the resilience of domestic the committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in international as well as greater volatility and dollar appreciation trend in the the copom evaluates despite the limitations in the supply the main scenario encompasses a more intense domestic activity pace in this and in the upcoming that a growth in the relevant horizon for the monetary more in line with potential in this recent information indicate recovery and continuity in household consumption favored by public transfers and by the vigor in the labor market which reflects in historically low unemployment rates and in wages in domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than gdp growth rates and tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy by the expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the program of public services among other the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal despite recent initiatives point to an expansionist position of the public sector the committee notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth strengthens the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit in the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over despite the moderation the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary pressures of the copom evaluates that the high inflation level and the dispersion of prices as recently contribute for inflation to show in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the deterioration in the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and it is necessary with the due it is the committee understands that the intensification of the adjustment pace of the monetary conditions underway is in this and continuing the basic interest rate the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without the committee evaluates that this decision will contribute to set inflation into decline and ensure that this trend persists in the upcoming the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the remaining effects of policy actions implemented in for the these the programs of public services the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of confidence create prospects for intensification and industrial production the committee considers that recent initiatives point to an expansionist position of the public sector on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international which it is ratified by the brazilian shows that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of businesses and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom notes in the short inflation shows elevation trend and that the balance of risks for the prospective scenario is the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain specially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the ones observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on july for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the changed in compared to in according to the the monthly deceleration reflected the decrease of to in market

for fixed asset retail sales and industrial production were than the ones recorded in the quarter ended in it is worth the decline of the manufacturing pmi to in may from in signaling the first contraction of chinese industry in seven financial markets remained operating in an environment of low volatility in most of the and the index cboe vix oscillated around thirteen the ample liquidity in the financial the upgrade of the greece sovereign bonds and the perception if the authorities will continue to act in a coordinated way to enlarge the monetary policies easing stances have supported the recovery of favoring the valuation of assets and the retreat of the sovereign risk in the most vulnerable economies in the euro in this the major stock exchanges appreciated especially the from and the from in the period between the dollar appreciated against the main movement favored by the expectation of anticipation of withdrawal of monetary stimuli by the federal reserve and by the reduction of the basic interest rate in the euro in the international commodities the improvement in the grain supply scenario and the prospects for good crops in coupled with the moderate recovery in global have favored the maintenance of a downward trend in prices for great part of the in coffee and iron on the other the resurgence of geopolitical tensions in syria favored upward adjustment in oil prices from the last ten days of after two months of reduction in the prices of brent according to the international financial from the the annual change in the overall cpi reached in down from in a result of inflationary downturns in advanced from to and in the emerging from to in the context of high idle capacity and persistent contraction of the the ecb reduced its benchmark interest rate refinancing at the beginning of by to a record low of and the marginal loan rate lending by to the scenario of moderate growth and decline in commodity prices also favored the maintenance of official interest rates at historical minimum rates by the central banks of the japan and the while the monetary authorities of south hungary and israel expanded the expansionary stances of their reducing again their respective basic trade and international reserves the brazilian trade balance showed a deficit of billion in as a result of billion in exports and billion in the accumulated deficit in the year totaled compared to a surplus of billion in the same period of reflecting a decrease of in exports and an increase of in according to the criterion of daily the total external trade expanded by in the totaling international reserves totaled billion in with an increase of billion in the in the there was no spot intervention in the domestic exchange market and open market operations after the april copom the domestic yield curve showed greater recording initially a deep downward resuming from resume the upward ending the period close to among the factors underpinning this it bears in the international the expectation of reduction of monetary stimuli by the the appreciation of the us dollar relative to other the elevation of the us treasuries rates and the continuity of uncertainties regarding the global economic the slow economic recovery and the collection of higher prices led to fluctuations in the short end of the yield between april and may and sixmonth interest rates increased by and the rates for one and twoyear maturities decreased by and while the rate increased by the real interest measured by the ratio between the nominal interest rate and the inflation expectation for the next twelve decreased from on april to on may mainly due to the rise in inflation in managing the liquidity of reserves the bcb carried from april to may repurchase agreements with maturities of six borrowing funds in the amount of from april the bcb conducted daily repurchase agreements with maturity of taking funds of the overall daily average of the operations outstanding increased from billion between march and april to between april and may the bcb also carried out overnight repo agreements on occasions as a it also conducted leveling operations at the end of the with tenure of two business the overall daily average of such overnight operations was billion in the the overall daily average of the total outstanding of repurchase agreements of the bcb increased from billion between march and april to billion between april and may considering the period between april and may the outstanding of repurchase agreements decreased from billion to the main factor driving the liquidity contraction in the period was the net revenues of the ipca inflation retreated in to down from in august and in as a inflation reached in the first nine months of the highest change in the period since up from in the same period of trailing inflation increased in up from in august in september resuming under this comparison the acceleration of consumer price inflation mirrors the behavior of both regulated prices and market market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through up from and in the twelve months through september despite the brl appreciation observed until the prices of tradable goods reaching to in september according to the same comparison regarding the prices of greatly pressured by the behavior of perishable food and services trailing inflation was even higher evidencing the influence of domestic factors over inflationary for the price of services increased in september up from in december and in september according to the same comparison preliminary data for october point to consumer inflation index above that observed in in the reversal of the progressive divergence trend of inflation from the targets which had been observed since the end of consolidated the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb have evolved differently from the headline the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation measures increased from and in august to and in while the trimmed means core inflation measure increased down from in similarly to the headline the three core inflation measures accelerated remarkably in the first nine months of the compared to the same period of with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core on a trailing the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices continues to record substantial rising from in july to in august and in the smoothed and trimmed means core inflation also despite at a lower under this in the last the smoothed trimmed means core inflation changed from in july to in august and in whereas the trimmed means core inflation changed from in july to in august and in as a all core inflation measures stand above the central value for the inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion whose average is the highest recorded since continues to suggest dissemination of the inflationary process relatively confirming the analysis present in previous copom the general price index inflation changed from in july to in august and in on a trailing inflation decreased to in down from in august and in compared to in september in the twelve months through the increase reflected the behavior of the three main the consumer price indexbrazil increased in september while the wholesale price index totaled in september according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in september regarding the agricultural inflation reached in the twelve months through september it also bears highlighting the continuity of upward pressures over wholesale industrial a process that began in the second half of and does not show consistent signs of in the first nine months of the wholesale industrial price inflation increased up from in the same period of in in the last twelve wholesale industrial price inflation increased in up from in december as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after growing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the expansion observed in industrial output retreated by in partially reflecting the unusual working day distribution observed this it bears noticing that general industrial output grew in the year through with respective increases of and in manufacturing and in mining on a industrial output expanded by in august one less working with respective growth of and in manufacturing and extraction the data already released for the last months in to the continuity of the industrial production expansion despite some accommodation at the margin may due to restrictions to supply expansion in some as well as to the effects of the monetary policy change in brazil and to the international financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the durable consumer goods production increased in regarding the other use intermediate goods production decreased consumer goods production retreated by while the production of capital goods production remained in the capital goods production leads the with an followed by the elevation in durable consumer goods the strength of capital goods production until august has reflected the consolidation of favorable prospects for the continuity of macroeconomic on its the expansion of durable goods production credit which until more favorable than historical labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey retreated from in july to in the same level reached in down from in september as a the average unemployment rate in the first nine months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate changed from in august to in showing stability in historically low levels in the last the nominal average earnings increased in and accelerated to in in real average earnings increased and in september it grew and highest level of the series since july behavior that evidences the labor market in the first nine months of real average earnings increased while employment grew as a real payrolls expanded by growth in september in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in august to in july and in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment decreased by in august to increases of in july and in in manufacturing employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment this with the creation of thousand jobs in august and thousand jobs in a record high for the and historical in the first nine months of the employment reached a record high of thousand above the previous record high observed for the historical series in an evidence of the robust demand for formal employment grew by in seasonally and observed data point to a expansion in the last twelve manufacturing industry recorded the highest hiring rate in with the creation of thousand new followed by the services sector thousand new and by the retail sector thousand new on the other the agricultural due to seasonal factors related to the observed in the part of the was the only sector recording employment retreat of thousand according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales decreased by in after increasing in july and in and grew by in august and in through expanded retail sales moving average decreased in interrupting the sequence of consecutive monthly increases in this according to seasonally adjusted on a it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of magazines and followed by food beverages and and and domestic in the year through cumulative growth was more significant in magazines and personal and domestic and parts and the decrease in expanded retail sales was already to the decrease of in vehicles sales in according to data seasonally adjusted by the national federation of distribution of automotive vehicles expanded retail sales should resume growth in reflecting the positive performance of vehicles which grew according to data seasonally adjusted by the the steady growth of retail sales had been in the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be favored by fiscal as well as by employment and income but it also will be in case of by the changes in the access to credit which cannot be fully associated to the monetary policy and by the deterioration of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in similarly to the level observed in after the increase to in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing industry showed a slight upward reaching in a record high for the series since without the seasonal the nuci stood above the level registered in august as a the average rate in the first eight months of was above the level observed in the same period of the monthly nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas reached in standing above the level registered in the same month of the elevation in the nuci in september is also observed in the production of civil construction inputs of consumer goods and of capital goods for the intermediate goods the nuci stood below the level observed in september the maintenance of installed capacity utilization rates at historically high levels occurs in several sectors highs for consumer goods sector and civil construction inputs sector were observed in despite investments made in the last twelve in recent data about the absorption of capital goods was still inconclusive about an inflexion in the investment expansion the absorption of capital goods increased in according to seasonally adjusted accumulating a expansion in in observed compared to and in according to the same comparison on the other the production of civil construction inputs showed stability at the margin in after increasing by in maintaining the growth in in evidences suggest although investment has been importantly contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization the maturation of investment projects has not been so to significantly limit the existing mismatches regarding the evolution of supply and domestic as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to register deceleration at the an already anticipated and which is in line with assessments present in previous inflation reports and copom in the last twelve months through september the trade surplus reached billion below september exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and according to the same comparison as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust expansion of domestic notwithstanding the elevated price levels of several commodities included in the brazilian export basket supporting factor for the exports value can moderate in case of persistence of recent trends in the prices of raw the decrease in trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through september equivalent to of foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the intensification of severe intensification of stress on international financial which originated in the us and but whose impact on emerging economies has become more the increased risk observed since after the bankruptcy of an important us financial led the authorities in the europe and oceania to intervene in an unprecedentedly way in their financial using wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money although systemic risk perception is still such accompanied by programs to reinforce the capital base of relevant financial seem to have managed to restore the functioning of the interbank the international liquidity contraction contributed to a deleverage process by asset which in turn has been pressuring down the prices of financial in the environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital pressures on emerging have in this the recent announcement of the currency swap agreements between the us federal reserve and the central bank of as well as with the monetary authority of the bank of korea and the bank of should contribute to mitigate however eliminate the impacts of international financial turmoil on emerging regarding the global macroeconomic the contraction trends seem to be gradually prevailing over the inflationary are still the dominant view still points to the at a moderate of global economic activity in and but data released in the last weeks indicate a more intense and generalized cooling of activity in mature there are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in europe and parts of asia was predominantly due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities which could be on the other the problems in the financial system have been aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in credit which may reinforce the contraction in financial conditions as a the risk of intensification of the us started to decelerate in the last quarter of and it still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector with spillover effects on the labor whose together with the negative wealth effect associated to the fall in the prices of financial has affected the significantly contributing for depressing the prevailing interpretation is that the activity in europe and japan may continue to lose dynamism in the next in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating inflationary pressures have reduced relatively on the other in emerging where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more the inflationary pressures have been more in this the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature whereas in emerging which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation in addition to the facts mentioned the situation seems to be more oil prices remain highly but reduced considerably since the last copom future markets have followed the prices of oil in the spot uncertainty concerning oil prices is remarkably as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the reaction to stimuli derived from previous changes on relative in addition to geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the great uncertainty inherent to the projections of oil the main scenario adopted by the which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in remains it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline the reduction of international oil prices can affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation the prices of other commodities also showed important reductions since the last copom reacting both to the greater pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and to the intensification of the global financial markets of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices were maintained at for the projections adjustments for electricity prices and fixed telephone prices were maintained unchanged at and for the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual was altered to down from the considered in the september this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total september the projection for regulated prices inflation in was altered to up from this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic on the benchmark based on the swap rates estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and increased by the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the september copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca variation remained relatively increasing from to ahead inflation expectations also increased from to considering the medians of expected monthly inflation expectations for remained at considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the september copom and remained above the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the figure considered at the previous copom and above the central target for the regarding projections based on the benchmark scenario increased in relation to the figure forecast at the september meeting and the projections based on the market scenario showed a slight in both remained above the central target for that policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets impose some adjustment in the balance of payments despite the increase in brazilian economy external can increase the inflationary especially in the short in general the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant on the one more generalized deceleration of global economic activity in the upcoming quarters points to an accommodation of both commodities prices and external therefore influencing negatively the local financial on the other the trend of economic cooling has caused an increase in risk impacting the demand for brazilian and depreciating their in this the additional reduction of net exports can with similar effects over the behavior in the prices of certain brazilian the recent trajectory of price indices still evidences the existence of significant inflationary in several despite the remarkably lower intensity compared to the middle of in light of the deterioration of inflation prospects occurred in the last in a more uncertain the committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario is still the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price indices do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to the worsening of the copom reaffirms that is still high the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation the heating of domestic demand and markets of despite under higher as well as the possibility of emergence of supply restrictions in some may facilitate the through of wholesale prices to consumer price the committee evaluates that the materialization of this and the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer price indices depend critically on which remain in levels incompatible with the inflation targets path and continue to be carefully it is worth pointing that although the external sector had been imposing some discipline on tradable goods the heating of domestic demand has pressured the prices of as in this the copom will act to ensure the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become doing the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as of inflation expectations within the forecast being ready to promptly adjust the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario in which price readjustments become persistent or the maintenance of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk the copom thinks that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance is essential to increase the probability that inflation in brazil evolves once again according to the targets path in for this higher probability to continue to it is necessary that inflation particularly the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation this viewpoint is even more important in periods of higher the prospects for the evolution of economic activity became more uncertain since the last copom in the effects of the international crisis on the domestic financial conditions indicate that the contribution of credit to support domestic demand may decline more intensively than the magnitude of what would happen exclusively by the monetary policy the intensification of international crisis seems to have caused a negative effect on and if this situation the strength of economic activity would increasingly depend on real payroll expansion and the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next these considerations become even more relevant considering the signs of still heated domestic demand at the end of the third the dissemination of pressures derived from relative prices including the labor and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities whose consistent signs emerged last could contribute to avoid even more intense inflationary the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues to present important risks to the inflationary to which may be particularly in the short the risks derived from the trajectory of brazilian assets in a process of decreasing external in this the prompt and consistent reduction of the mismatch between the growth of aggregate demand and supply of goods and services continues to be crucial to the assessment of different possibilities for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to higher risk to shorter planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects on income in the current there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation acceleration become reducing the efficacy of monetary the strategy aims to bring inflation rates timely back to the midpoint target established by cmn already in this which will have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the economic heating signs for labor market available data and the industry capacity utilization and the behavior of inflation the risks for the materialization of a benign inflation in which ipca would resume evolution in line with the targets continue an unfavorable scenario is still present in the inflation projections by the the copom also thinks that the persistence of a significant mismatch between the growth paces of aggregate supply and demand continues to represent risk for the inflationary but evaluates that the expected trajectories of domestic consumption and investment have become more under these monetary policy should act according to the requirements of the balance of risks of the inflationary through the adjustment of the basic interest although not necessarily in a continuous on the one to reduce that mismatch on the other to avoid that inflationary pressures initially restricted to some prices indices lead to a persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation the committee thinks that the consolidation of more restrictive financial conditions could intensify the effects of monetary policy over aggregate demand throughout over in such evaluating the prospective scenario and the balance of risks for inflation in a more uncertain the copom unanimously at this to keep unchanged the selic rate at without under the the copom guides its decisions according to the projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking prices dynamics and the balance of risks associated to their domestic demand continues to increase supporting the economic activity including sectors less exposed to external at a moment when the effects of stimuli such as income are still influencing the brazilian in the contribution of the external sector to a favorable inflationary in light of the strong depreciation in the prices of brazilian assets and the apparent reduction in the capacity to has become less at a moment when the effects of investment on the productive potential still need to in this the monetary policy should act so to bring inflation back to the targets path already in in order to avoid that the higher uncertainty detected in horizons disseminate to if the risk profile changes in a way that implies shifts in the basic prospective scenario for inflation considered by the committee in this the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the at the end of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on december for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in comuniqué of september of data analyzed by the copom ipca reached in repeating compared to in for the second consecutive the prices of food and beverages decreased in after in and contributed to the september market prices increased in up from in the previous with price elevations of for tradable and for regulated prices increased up from in the diffusion index reached in down from in reaching a average in on a trailing ipca increased up from in mainly due to the increases on market prices and regulated prices ipca core inflation indices increased in the last twelve months through while the core inflation by exclusion and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation measures accelerated over the same core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in up from in totaling in the last twelve compared to in the previous the trimmed means core increased from in august to in while on a it increased from to the smoothed trimmed mean core inflation reached in up from in reaching over the last twelve compared to in the previous increased in after a decrease in reaching over the last twelve within the index only ipa with a increase in comparison to a decrease in reaching a increase over the last twelve decreased after increasing by in reaching over the last twelve incc increased in september in and in the last twelve the milder variation of in september reflected the persistent decrease in the prices of food and beverages and deceleration in the prices of the remaining components of the except for core increased in down from in reaching a increase over the last twelve the september ipa result reflected the less sharpen fall in agricultural while industrial prices showed decreased in in comparison to a decrease in reaching over the last twelve grew down from in the previous reaching over the last twelve by stages of ipa decelerated regarding the prices of intermediate goods increasing in down from in while the prices of final goods decreased after a slight increase in the previous the prices of raw material increased reverting the august result in the last twelve months ipa by stages of processing registered and partial indexes on october inflation show acceleration relative to september results for both wholesale and consumer price grew reflecting the hike on clothing and the reversal in the fall of food and beverages as for according to results for the second period of agricultural and industrial prices indicate stronger growth than on the previous activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly survey expanded retail which include construction material and vehicles and parts and decreased in despite the retreat in the expanded six out of the ten segments surveyed by the ibge with highlights to the elevation in the sales of office materials and the sales of parts and pieces decreased in the comparing equivalent periods of and sales grew in august and in considering the expanded retail according to these two comparison there was generalized growth in all with highlights for office material and other personal and domestic and furniture and home parts and pieces strongly decelerated in growing by despite the strong growth observed in the year according to são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the database consultations for credit sales increased in while consultations to the usecheque system decreased by according to the same comparison in the year through these indicators increased and compared to the same period of regarding investment domestic production of capital goods and construction typical inputs remained relatively stable in seasonally while on a these indicators grew and in the year through compared to the same period of the production of capital goods grew while the production of construction typical inputs grew capital goods imports increased in september the quantum capital goods imports grew according to data from fundação centro de estudos do comércio exterior seasonally adjusted by the the september indicator expanded by higher than the growth result and through september result reflecting the recent dynamism of capital goods imports and its contribution to the current cycle of investments in the brazilian cni indicators show a stable industrial activity pace in with a increase in hours worked in industrial in contrast with a reduction in installed capacity considering seasonally adjusted the strong fall in seasonally adjusted real revenues in august came after increase over the two previous resulting in growth in the quarter ended in in comparison to the same periods in real revenues grew in august and in the year through while hours worked in industrial production increased and according to the same comparison installed capacity utilization reached in below the july considering seasonally adjusted according to monthly industrial survey industrial production decreased in august seasonally fifteen out of the activities surveyed recorded production decrease in the with highlights to the negative performance in the production of chemical products oil refine and ethanol production influenced by the technical interruption in one of the it is also noteworthy the decline in the production of food products considering to the use categories in the seasonally adjusted the unfavorable industrial performance reflected mainly the retraction in intermediate goods production comparing to the sharpest fall since october durable goods production expanded by while the production of and consumer goods registered a slight retreat of comparing to august industrial production increased a percentage

economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the strong recovery in some economic sectors seems to be partly due to the pandemic resurgence in some major there is significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of this scenario due to a possible decline in government stimuli and to the evolution of the the moderation in financial assets volatility keeps resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging turning to the brazilian similarly to other recent indicators suggest an uneven recovery in economic sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the transfer uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than especially for the period starting at the end of this concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer the various measures of underlying inflation are in levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the latest inflation readings were higher than and the committee raised its projection for the remaining months of this revision was due to continuing food and industrial price increases in are a consequence of a persistent exchange rate the oil price and the income transfer on the one the partial normalization of some depressed prices should in a context of a recovery in mobility indices and activity on the other some which rose extraordinarily due to a temporary reduction in supply in conjunction with an occasional increase in are expected to in spite of the inflationary the committee maintains the diagnosis that this shock is although closely monitoring its the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at rises to in and in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and exchange rate starting and evolving according to the ppp yields inflation projections around for for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation especially when this slack is concentrated in the service this risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary on the other the extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the relative increase in the risks of these events imply an upward asymmetry to the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the international the recent pandemic resurgence and the consequent increase in social distancing in some of the major economies may interrupt recovery in a potential and abrupt reduction of governmental stimuli also brings risks to the economic for the reduction in financial asset volatility keeps resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging the committee judged that there is significant uncertainty about the evolution of this the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they assessed that recent data suggest an uneven recovery in economic the transfer programs from the government have allowed for a relatively strong rebound in durable goods consumption and several service sector especially those more directly affected by social distancing remain significantly the unpredictability associated with the pandemic evolution and the necessary adjustment in government spending from onwards increases the uncertainty about the maintenance of the economic activity the committee considered that this unpredictability and the risks associated with the evolution of the pandemic may imply a domestic scenario characterized by an even more gradual economic the copom members debated on the level of economic as with the committee believes that the pandemic should continue to have heterogeneous effects on the economic given the nature of the the economic slack in the service sector should remain larger than in other the committee concluded that the nature of the crisis probably implies that disinflationary pressures from reduced demand may last longer than in previous the committee then resumed the discussion of a potential effective lower limit for the brazilian policy interest rate and its connection with prudential and financial stability considering the long history of the brazilian economy operating at very high levels of selic unprecedented low interest rates may compromise the performance of some markets and economic with a potential impact on financial for the majority of the copom we would already be close to the level from which further interest rate reductions could be accompanied by asset price the copom members discussed on the maintenance of the signaling that remaining space for monetary policy if it should be the committee assessed that this signaling is due to prudential restrictions regarding reductions of the selic rate should be kept in the committee discussed the implementation of the monetary policy since its the copom has adopted forward according to it does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are the committee judged that those conditions continue to inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline are significantly below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary the current fiscal regime has not been and inflation expectations remain well the copom continued its considering not only the baseline but also the balance of and restrictions of prudential regardless of prudential the copom considered at this the upward asymmetry in the balance of risks caused by fiscal risks is sufficient to compensate the fact that its inflation projections in the baseline scenario are below the target at the relevant the deemed as adequate the current level of monetary which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at and by the forward regardless of prudential nature the committee discussed the interpretation of the fiscal clause of its forward which conditions the of interest rates to the maintenance of the current fiscal the committee judged that changes in the fiscal policy that affect the public debt trajectory or compromise the fiscal anchor would motivate a even if the spending ceiling in nominal terms is still this reassessment would follow the usual guidance of an inflation targeting based on prospective inflation and its balance of monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes and the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes due to prudential and financial stability the remaining space for monetary policy if it should be the committee deems as adequate the current level of monetary which is being provided by the maintenance of the policy rate at and by the forward guidance introduced in its the forward guidance stated that the copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions are the committee judges that those conditions continue to inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline are significantly below the inflation target for the relevant horizon for monetary the current fiscal regime has not been and inflation expectations remain well the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro damaso and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the monetary stimuli and the reopening of major economies still sustain a favorable environment for emerging turning to the brazilian the second quarter gdp release as well as the most recent indicators continue to show a positive evolution and do not ensue relevant revisions in growth which display a robust economic recovery during the second half of the the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and consumer inflation remains industrial goods price increases due to higher input supply and redirecting of services demand towards goods has not subsided and should remain a pressure in the short in services inflation has accelerated in recent reflecting the gradual normalization of the as pressures persist in volatile components such as food and fuel prices and especially electricity due to factors including the exchange commodity and adverse weather the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that rises to in and to during and drops to during in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the energy flag is assumed to be in december and level in december of and risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the recent increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a inflation in the baseline on the other further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the risk in spite of the recent improvement of debt sustainability the elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global there are two additional risk factors to the growth of emerging reductions in forecasts for growth in asian reflecting the evolution of the delta a tightening of monetary conditions in various emerging as a reaction to recent inflation the monetary stimuli and the reopening of major economies still sustain a favorable environment for emerging the committee continues to consider that a new round of market discussion regarding inflationary risks in advanced economies could result in a challenging environment for emerging the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and the slightly second quarter gdp result was followed by more negative high frequency albeit evolving these revisions stem partly from an anticipation of the expected growth for some of the sectors hardest hit by the and partly from the lower industrial output due to continued shortage in supply the committee maintained its view of a robust recovery in activity in the second half of the as the effects of vaccination are felt more for copom considers that economic growth should benefit from three the continued recovery of the labor market and the services even if to a lesser extent than previously the performance of sectors less dependent on the business cycle such as agriculture and livestock and the extractive and the remaining effects of the normalization of the economy as the health crisis the copom members then debated the level of economic the reduction of unemployment as the workforce and the occupied population increase denotes that the labor market continues to the levels at which the last two variables stand are considerably lower than those observed before the suggesting a remaining gap in the labor in face of the difference between main employment indicators in the formal jobs segment continuous pnad and novo the latter showing a more robust recovery than the former there are still some difficulties in assessing the real status of the labor copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus the exchange rate at purchasing power and commodity prices in usd stable in real the inflation projections are slightly above the targets for and around the target for the committee judged that the fiscal risks continue to imply an upward bias in the this asymmetry in the balance of risks affects the appropriate degree of monetary stimulus thus justifying a path for monetary policy that is more restrictive than the path used in the baseline in the face of this copom evaluated the costs and benefits of accelerating the pace of interest rate considering the the stage of the adjustment cycle is characterized by an already effectively tightening monetary which is evidenced when looking at the difference in expectations for the paths of interest rate and inflation over the relevant monetary policy simulations with interest rate hikes that assume different terminal rates suggest that the current pace of adjustment is sufficient to reach a significantly restrictive level and to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target in even considering the asymmetry of the balance of the weight of volatile items in the revisions of inflation projections and the uniqueness of the economic readjustment process reinforce the benefit of accumulating more information about the state of the economy and the persistence of the existing copom concluded at this maintaining the current pace of adjustment coupled with the extension of the magnitude of the process of monetary tightening to a significantly restrictive level is the most appropriate strategy for assuring the convergence of inflation to the and monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes to a lesser without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers at the present stage of the tightening this pace is the most appropriate to guarantee inflation convergence to the target at the relevant horizon allow the committee to obtain more information regarding the state of the economy and the persistence of at this the baseline scenario and balance of risks indicate as appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening further into the restrictive for the next the committee foresees another adjustment of the same copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda rumenos manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation reduced from in to in as a inflation accumulated in the first seven months of reached decreasing relative to the level registered in the same period of the previous in the last twelve inflation reduced from in june to in july in december and in july returning towards the target after eighteen the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the first seven months of the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated prices considering market both prices of tradable goods and goods cooled on a trailing reaching and in down from and in december and in the same month of the previous according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of increased from in december to in july in july preliminary data for august point to consumer inflation below that observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed last year has been gradually overcome by a process that should continue to be led by the behavior of market while regulated price inflation should show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb decreased in the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices decreased from in june to in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures also recording and in and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced from in december to in july to in july the general price index inflation changed from in june to in on a trailing the inflation decreased from in june to in compared to in july the slowdown of the has basically reflected the behavior of its main the wholesale price index which decreased from in june to in according to the same comparison basis in july on its the consumer price increased up to july in july and the civil construction national index increased in july regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached in july while wholesale industrial prices reached in july as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in june and in still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output increased by in june and in july pointing the seventh month in a roll of on a industrial output retreated by in june and in with respective falls of and in mining and manufacturing the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output series and its at the according to data suggests that production reached its record low in and was followed by gradual industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international due to its effects both over exports and credit and over business and among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the it bears highlighting the increase in the production of durable consumer strongly influenced by the automotive regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased and consumer goods production increased while the production of capital goods increased by the at the in the dynamism of industrial led by production of the durable tax exemption measures and also some easing of credit the future behavior of industrial production which should not be uniform over will depend on these as well as on the gradual recovery of consumer and businessmen counterbalancing the deterioration of external labor market tends to behave more in which resilient aspects prevail before signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey changed from in may to in june and in july in july according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate changed from in down to in june and average real earnings increased by in in on its expanded by in according to the same comparison as a real payroll reached in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment decreased by in in and expanded by on a trailing according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment decreased by in and presented stability in the last twelve still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that the generation of formal employment has continued to record some despite below the seasonal in jobs were created to the positive result of in the manufacturing industry showed positive balance for the the commerce sector continued the recovery trajectory initiated in with the positive result of the civil construction the most dynamic and the services sector continued hiring workers this and the agricultural and livestock sector generated according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after expansion of in on a the indicator increased by growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after recording in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of material and and parts and the negative key drivers were and and in the cumulative growth was more significant in material and and and medical after consecutive falls in the last months of expanded retail sales data have evidenced mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to some improvement in the access to vehicle credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in slightly above the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the and above the record low reached in the series seasonally adjusted by cni changed from in to in considering the monthly series without seasonal in june the nuci was below the level registered in the same month of on its the monthly nuci without seasonal calculated by fundação getúlio vargas increased in august to up from in below the level observed in the same month of the reduction in the nuci according to the comparison is also observed in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and construction inputs the same indicator seasonally adjusted by fgv changed from to between june and increasing compared to the minimum observed in the reduction on the nuci calculated by cni and according to the same comparison seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic and points to significant idle capacity in the manufacturing regarding the absorption of capital data indicate continuity of retraction and expansion at the the absorption of capital goods increased by in july a decrease in according to seasonally adjusted and decreased in according to observed on its the production of construction inputs decreased by at the margin in after a increase in accumulating a fall in the in evidences suggest that demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry although the ones regarding the utilization rates have increased in the last as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance reduced at the under this the trade surplus reached billion in decreasing to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts in the opposite the reduction in remittances of profits and dividends has contributed to limit the current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress reduction in international financial despite not in a monotonic the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the us and using a wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary have continued to moderate the perception of systemic in this there have been signs of reduction in risk but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to the decreasing trend of risk aversion and scarcity of capital as well as some concern about the fiscal situation in the continued to encourage the recovery of both from emerging and mature against the us regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary but recovery of economic activity seems to have the current predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in with recovery in the consensual projections point to a retraction of activity in the europe and japan which be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences that economic activity in could be with signs of improvements in industrial activity and stabilization in real estate market in the recovery of manufacturing activity and business confidence in germany and industrial recovery in on the other the problems in the international financial system might continue to be aggravated by the cyclical deterioration in the quality of focused on the us and which could reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions as a hinder the consolidation of economic in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has decelerated considerably and for a longer inflationary pressures reduced the disinflation process seems to have gained momentum also in the emerging in spite of greater persistence of the inflationary in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy in a significant number of monetary policy seems to have entered into a stability while the increase in public sector debt imposes limits on the scope of any additional fiscal oil prices have increased since the last copom as well as future markets uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in the context of global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investments maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive such as the or through the transportation costs for as well as through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact in the evolution of food such as soybeans and had heterogeneous behavior since the last copom while quotations of metallic industrial such as and showed expressive of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following similarly to the july copom the projected adjustments for gasoline prices for were kept unchanged at while the projected for bottled gas prices rose to in the same regarding the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity prices for the first one reduced to from percentage considered in the july while the second one increased to from the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was kept unchanged at this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total july the projection for regulated prices inflation for kept unchanged at percentage considered at the july copom such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and in unchanged relative to the july those figures do not take into account petrobras contribution to the public sector primary surplus and are adjusted by the possibility of reduction by up to in due to the implementation of the investment pilot program and in due to the ppi implementation and the growth acceleration program the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca changed from to for inflation expectations also changing from to considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the july copom meeting and is below the target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also decreased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom meeting and is also below the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark projection increased and is close to whereas decreased under the market scenario although remaining also close to policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic the risk aversion increase and the constraint of liquidity condition prevailing in international markets continue to show significant easing at the in since the last copom signs of a global risk aversion reduction continue to despite still subject to with impacts over both brazilian asset as well as selected also influencing domestic financial it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary especially in mature but also in some emerging despite the increase in commodities prices since early the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to until predominantly the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized pressures may impose risk to the inflationary trajectory is the moderation of domestic demand pressures over the market of despite remaining subject to should contain the risk of of upward pressures stemming from wholesale the evaluates that the materialization of such as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized over the consumer prices still depends critically on economic inflation inflation expectations for and decreased since the last copom remain in line with the targets path and continue to be closely it is worth noticing that the behavior of domestic demand should exert less pressure over the prices of such as in the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of economic activity have continued to improve since last copom in particular relative to consumption and more recently also to industrial production although in this particular case reflecting the accommodation of external demand as in light of international crisis effects over domestic financial credit contribution to sustain domestic demand has although signs of recovery continue to in particular regarding credit loans to the severity of the international crisis influenced negatively consumers and businessmen confidence but also in this case there are more consistent signs of under such the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll expansion and on the effects of fiscal stimulus and governmental transfers that will occur over the following it should also benefit from the easing of financial in the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the evaluation mentioned in previous copom meetings that the contraction effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which the monetary policy could become but would not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have impacts concentrated in the copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism has caused an increase in the idleness margin of factors resulting in reduction of inflationary on the other the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario on the short from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and regulated items since the beginning of as well as from a possible increase in commodities in the the risk stems from the cumulative and lagged from the financial conditions easing and fiscal stimulus over the evolution of domestic taking into account the dynamics of consumption and in a context of recovery of production factors the balance of those influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk for both private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over the income as a the copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation remains in a level consistent with the target path in and such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the increase of the idleness margin of the economy in to the industrial capacity utilization rates and certain aspects of labor as well as to the behavior of inflation expectations for relevant the materialization of a benign inflation in which the ipca would resume evolution in line with the target has remained such evolution of the scenario continues to be reflected on inflation projections considered by the as well as on inflation expectations set by independent under such in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflation scenario under a macroeconomic scenario with significant the copom evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets the committee understands that the demand motivated by tightening of financial conditions and by deterioration of although marginal improvements continue to be as well as by the global economic activity which could also be has created significant idleness margin of production which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic the copom emphasizes that there are uncertainties around such basic with positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity such contemplated under the basic should contribute to restrain inflationary on the other the committee notices that the significant monetary policy implemented from january to will have cumulative effects over the which will be evidenced with a time the committee understands that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the total adjustment made from january to whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over in a context of slow recovery of production factors the copom also evaluates that a more cautious stance will contribute to mitigate the risk of abrupt reversals of monetary policy in the future to the consistent recovery of the economy over the next the copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates to be closely monitored over under such in light of the inflation perspectives regarding the targets the copom has unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate in without taking into in one the monetary policy easing implemented since january on the other the idleness margin of production among other the committee evaluates that such level of basic interest rate is consistent with a benign inflation contributing to assure the maintenance of inflation the targets path over the relevant horizon and to the recovery of economic under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a long period of domestic demand started to exert contractionist influence over economic despite the persistence of incentive such as income it bears noticing that evidencing the credibility achieved by the copom on the implementation of the inflation expectations for and remain in line with targets it is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial on the other important monetary and fiscal stimuli were introduced into the economy over the last few months and should contribute to the activity recovery to the reduction of the idleness margin of production those stimuli effects must be closely monitored over time and are important in the context where future monetary policy which should ensure the materialization of the convergence to targets path over relevant will be at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on october for technical presentations and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom the increased in down from in reaching over in comparison to over the same period in over the last twelve up to the increased in comparison to in the last twelve months up to housing increased relative to in july and was the key influence over august results especially residential electric whose individual impact reached market prices reached in the same as in with a decrease of on tradable items and an increase of on over the same regulated prices increased down from in over the last twelve months market prices reached a the lowest rate since july while regulated prices reached the diffusion index reached down from in july and in core inflation measures calculated with the use of accelerated in the core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in up from in the smoothed trimmed means core reached up from over the previous the trimmed means core reached up from over the same on a trailing basis up to august there were reductions on the smoothed and trimmed core which reached and in comparison to and in while the excluding core went from in july to in the changed in in comparison to in with decelerations in both ipc and incc deceleration and a milder decrease on the has reached in and over the last twelve the ipa changed in in comparison to in accumulating a fall over and also a decrease on a twelve month trailing the ipc reached down from in the previous reaching a high in and over the last twelve the incc increased in comparison to in reaching a high in and over the last twelve economic activity according to data seasonally adjusted by the monthly survey expanded retail sales increased in in comparison to after a increase in may and a fall in as a the average for the quarter ending in june reached a relative to the quarter ended in march and represented the best result of the quarter exceeding in the sales increased in six out of ten segments with highlights for the increase in office material and equipment vehicles and parts and pieces clothing and shoes among the negative highlights go for fuel and lubricants construction inputs and magazines and stationary the comparison between june and june revealed expansion of in expanded retail sales in the over the first half of growth reached while reaching over twelve june ratio meant a new series above the average for and above the prior to the crisis in growth drivers in comparison to june were office material and equipment as well as vehicles and parts and pieces as for decrease in highlights for construction with a over up to seven out of ten segments increased sales and it bears emphasizing office material and equipment pharmaceutical and perfumery items other personal and domestic items as well as magazines and stationary as negative under the same comparison construction inputs decreased the with a são paulo trade association data related to the city of são indicated a decrease in database consultation for credit sales and a fall in consultations to the usecheque system on a seasonally adjusted those indicators decreased and in comparison to the same period of the previous year and decreased and on a automobile sales by which take into account light commercial trucks and declined in seasonally according to fenabrave federation of auto vehicles total sales decreased in comparison to july where it bears highlighting the decrease on buses and trucks while automobiles increased over up to automobiles sales increased with a decline on trucks sales and a decline on buses on the same comparison automobiles and light commercial vehicles increased and general industrial physical production increased in july seasonally according to monthly industrial survey physical production over and also on a twelvemonth there are still signs of of and among the four use it bears highlight the durable consumer goods industry with a while the semidurable and nondurable consumer goods industry presented the mildest increase the extractive industry physical production decreased after a increase in reaching a fall over and a fall on a trailing capital goods imports increased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the july indicator decreased in comparison to july reaching a decline in the year through year over on the same comparison exports decreased relative to july and in the year through capital goods production increased but presented declines of relative to july and over the according to data released by as a capital goods absorption increased in july while presenting a decline of relative to july and of over through construction inputs production decreased in seasonally with a decline in comparison to july and over the year up to gross fixed capital formation increased in july but still presents declines of in comparison to july and over cni indicators showed some moderate recovery of industrial activity for the second consecutive manufacturing industry real revenues increased resulting on a growth ending in according to a series seasonally adjusted by the relative to hours worked in and the survey declines of and on the same comparison the installed capacity utilization increased relative to reaching on a seasonally adjusted vehicles production reached thousand units in according to which was lower than in july according to seasonally adjusted vehicles production decreased from january to july there were declines of on vehicles production and on agricultural while reaching and over the year up to domestic sales of vehicles decreased in july and over the up to july on the same comparison basis relative to while exports decreased and the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in july estimated the production of million tons in representing a decrease relative to concerning corn and soybean declines of and whereas increases of were for the production of black beans and and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index remained almost stable in decreasing reflecting a decrease in the current economic conditions index and a increase in the consumer expectations index the icc increased mainly due to the retraction of in the icea and to the expansion of in the according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the the icc decreased in seasonally after five consecutive months of this index retreated in august due to the retreat of future which had favored its recent recovery in the previous in the current situation index increased and the expectations index decreased the icc increased recording two consecutive monthly reaching a level next to the registered in september the isa and the ie increased and in relation to the expectations for the manufacturing the fgv manufacturing industry survey in recovery of in the industry confidence index seasonally although it is still below the level recorded in august considering the observed among the same comparison there are increases of and the current situation index and retreats of and in the expectations index compared to august market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in july fourth best result of the series in this compared to thousand jobs created in totaling thousand jobs in the first seven months of and thousand new jobs in the last twelve months through among economic all the sectors showed with highlights for the construction sector and agriculture and which registered the highest net hires in july thousand and followed by the services sectors and the retail sector thousand and it is important to highlight that the manufacturing industry registered positive performance on hiring for the fourth consecutive with a thousand net hire in seasonally adjusted data showed a increase in employment in with highlight for the increase of the construction the average of the year through july showed a increase in influenced by the increases of in the construction in the services sector and in the retail whereas in the manufacturing industry it declined by according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in july the lowest historical level for the showing relative stability and considering the evolution of the observed data there were increases of in the number of employed workers and of in the economically active population which totaled thousand and thousand the creation of new jobs was the highest in thirteen surpassing by to july the same survey pointed out that average real earnings of employed workers resumed growth in margin in july after five consecutive months of increasing and growing by in the year through the

and in the same month of representing the lowest level registered in environment the contraction signs for the global economy are with some particularly in recording economic growth in the second quarter in annualized gdp in south japan and taiwan increased by and over the previous while china showed again acceleration of gdp on an annual rate of among european both germany and france grew over the same on a quarterly basis the inventories cycle adjustment in the main developed economies is in advanced especially in the retail industrial production has recorded positive results for four consecutive months in japan and for three months in the us economy in the first monthly advance in industrial production since october and production of the euro zone has been showing stability since last the us real estate central for the financial has showed more robust signs of while the national index of house measured by the recorded in the second quarter an increase of from the previous the first increase in three the consumer price indices through july confirmed the deflationary trend in the the euro japan and and the deflationary behavior in the united australia in in emerging the low rates of installed capacity the decline in prices to producers and the favorable basis effect in the energy prices are still determining this the maintenance of the current price per barrel of oil could put pressure on the behavior of these indicators from the last quarter of this the financial market follows which has not prevented corrections in some the vix index has remained fairly whereas the indices for stock markets of major economies continued to appreciate in with the exception of whose index has behaved more the libor in continued to the same occurring with the spread between this rate and the overnight index swap in the same the conditions for granting credit to consumers and corporate remain considering this the central banks from mature economies maintained the accommodative stance of their monetary including in some such as us and united of programs to help the financial the central banks of emerging economies such as russia and chile continued to deepen the cuts in their basic interest for only the central bank of israel marked the disruption of the easing stance of monetary having raised the basic interest rate by basis points to trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in the first eight months of the increasing by on a daily average in the exports reached and decreasing by and on a daily average the decrease of of exports in the first eight months of the year reflects the slowdown in world economic activity and the effects on prices of major products total external trade reached billion in decreasing by on a daily average in the year through total external trade reached lower than the one registered last according to the same comparison based on the liquidity international which encompass the repurchase lines and borrowing operations in foreign reached billion in recording a billion increase in the under the cash international reserves totaled recording a billion increase according to the same comparison in the for receiving the special allocation of special drawing rights of the international monetary fund amounting to market and open market operations after the july copom the yield curve slope increased with the future interest rates remaining almost while the future medium and interest rates showed the prospect of interrupting the cycle of monetary easing and the benign inflation scenario contributed to the maintenance of shortterm in the intermediate section and along the the upward movement of rates was influenced by the release of unemployment data below market the improvement of some indicators of the us economy and the rising interest rates on us between july and august and three rates decreased by bps and whereas and rates increased by bps and real interest measured by the differential between the oneyear forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on july to on august the average daily balance of the stock of repo operations of bcb ranged from billion in the period between june and july to billion between july and august the main determinant of the reduction in liquidity was the net issuance of securities by the treasury in reaching in its open market the bcb carried in the same long fixed rate repo borrowing billion for a the average daily balance of the and operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of and working days on july of working days on july of working days on august of working days on august and of working days on august these operations drained from the market billion and the average daily balance of these borrowing operations reached the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of liquidity management operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily between july and august the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached being billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and ipca inflation decreased slightly to in down from in as a in the year inflation reached decreasing relative to the previous remaining near the the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated price inflation considering market both prices of tradable and goods reaching and in down from and in according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of slightly changed to in down from in preliminary data for january point to consumer inflation above the level observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary acceleration cycle observed in was overcome by a process led by the behavior of market specially while regulated price and services inflation continues to show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased between november and the core inflation by exclusion changed from in november to in smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation measures also recording and in up from and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and double weight trimmed means core note that all core measures according to trailing compared to local record lows observed in october and two of them are above the inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced to in december compared to in december the general price index inflation changed from in november to in in the inflation reached in the slowdown of the reflected the behavior of all its three its main the wholesale price index reached in in on its the consumer price increased in and the civil construction national index increased in regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives from the behavior of both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached in while wholesale industrial prices reached in as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation the brazilian institute of geography and statistics released gdp as well as a review of previous which showed a contraction in from the aggregate demand expansion was led by household consumption and public administration which increased and gross fixed capital exports and imports contracted and according to the same comparison the contribution of domestic absorption to output growth was in the third quarter of overweighing the positive contribution of the external from the aggregate supply still according to the the services sector performed with a while all the other sectors the gdp deflator measured by market according to the same comparison changed from in the fourth quarter of to in the first quarter of in the first half of and in the first nine months of on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased from in september and october to in still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output decreased by in after ten consecutive months of on a industrial output increased after retreating by in the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output and its suggests that production reached its through in december and january and has been followed by gradual which continues to be influenced by the international by business and as well as by the developments domestic financial supported by traditional sources of besides the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in it bears highlighting the production of capital and intermediate with and durable consumer goods strongly influenced by the automotive decreased while and consumer goods production declined the recovery in the dynamism of industrial despite initially led by production of durable has become more widespread than to great tax exemption as well as also the easing in financial the future behavior of industrial which should not be uniform over will depend on these as well as on the evolution of consumer and businessmen but should be a source of counterbalancing the recovery of external labor market has behaved more with benign aspects prevailing over signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey changed from in october to in november in november according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached down from in the previous average real earnings remained stable for the second consecutive on its increased in after retreating by in as a real payroll reached over november continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that the formal employment has continued to recover in the second half of despite the seasonal job cuts in thousand jobs were created in thousand in the manufacturing industry showed positive balance of thousand the most dynamic sectors were with the creation of thousand jobs increase compared to commerce thousand a increase over the previous and civil construction thousand a while the agricultural and livestock sector lost thousand according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after decreasing by in on a the indicator increased in growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after recording in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of and and the negative key drivers were personal and domestic and magazines and since the beginning of expanded retail sales data have evidenced mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to the improvement in the access to credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit and by the evolution of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal adjustment reached in december above the level registered in the same month of the cni series seasonally adjusted by the bcb changed from to between october and considering the monthly series with seasonal the nuci calculated by fgv reached in december in the previous above the average observed in the last five the nuci in the consumer goods and building material industries in december was above the average of the last five recording and the nuci in the intermediate goods and capital goods industries grew and compared to the same the reduction of the idle capacity has been led by the expansion in economic not totally offset by the maturity of investment on its data regarding the absorption of capital goods show recovery compared to the same periods of and significant expansion at the margin in november third consecutive month of expansion compared to the previous the absorption of capital goods increased in according to seasonally adjusted a increase in but decreased in the according to observed on its the production of construction inputs increased by at the margin in after a increase in october and a increase in accumulating a fall in the also according to in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have been increasing in the last showing important reduction in the idle margin of the followed by the recovery of as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance showed stability at the reaching a billion surplus in and decreasing to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of trade the reduction in remittances of profits and despite the behavior observed at the has contributed to limit the trailing current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was initially marked by the continuity of the normalization process in international financial more by some increase in the volatility of asset although the perception of systemic risk continues these developments can be attributed to increased regulatory uncertainty and fiscal deterioration in some mature as well as the beginning of the reversal of the strong liquidity expansion occurred in in emerging under these there was moderation in demand for risky as evidenced by the behavior of international financial the us dollar strengthened against other especially those who had experienced more intense appreciation in previous regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevailed over inflationary pressures in but recovery of economic activity seems to have been the current predominant view points to the recovery in and some acceleration in in a process where the europe and japan would recover some but which would continue to be led by emerging especially from uncertainty regarding the sustainability of the expansion of consumption in mature economies still in a scenario of withdrawal of economic policy stimuli and modest prospects for credit on the other in many emerging economic activity seems to have embarked on a consistent path of in some evidence of heat in the markets of production factors and the inflation record lows in mature economies and major emerging economies have been in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy in several monetary policy began a phase of whereas those economies that were less impacted by the crisis and recover more quickly and intensely show a trend of adoption of more restrictive monetary policy oil spot prices have retreated since the last copom future markets have retreated as uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in a context of global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can eventually affect domestic prices through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact on the evolution of food such as soybeans and have decreased since the last copom while industrial commodities such as copper and have of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity prices for were kept unchanged at and the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was kept unchanged at this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total december the projection for regulated prices inflation for increased from to on the benchmark such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be adjusted by the possibility of reduction by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refer to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to the level of of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations was kept unchanged at the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered in the december copom and lies around the target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for slightly standing around the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection remained stable relative to the figure considered in the december copom and around the inflation midpoint the projection under the market scenario decreased and stands below the midpoint policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in international risk aversion has shown some increase since the last copom despite the persistence of abundant under this both brazilian asset which had also been favoring the easing of domestic financial as well as the prices of some selected showed it bears emphasizing that the prospects for foreign funding of brazilian economy remain on the other the trajectory of producer price indices evidence the despite still of external inflationary the benign impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path could come to an despite the persistence of significant uncertainty regarding the behavior of asset and commodities prices in the context of gradual normalization of international financial the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom believes if the prospect of intensification of demand pressures over the domestic market of factors is the probability that initially located inflationary episodes pose risks to the inflation trajectory could be in this the risk of of possible wholesale price upward pressures to consumer prices would the committee judges that the materialization of this as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer continues to depend critically on the economic for by the the committee continues to carefully monitor the behavior of inflation which have risen for the intermediate section of the forecast period since the last it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand could exert some pressure over the prices of such as in the upcoming in any the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom considers important to once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current inflation the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain as evidenced by data on manufacturing capacity utilization and the labor and by signs of continued expansion of credit both for individuals and consumer and business confidence also show consistent signs of under these the pace of activity depends significantly upon the evolution of real the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and the increments of governmental transfers that will occur in the upcoming the dynamism of activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial among other by the policies of official in the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the assessment mentioned in previous copom meeting minutes that the contraction effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which the monetary policy could become but would not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have more impacts from the middle of the copom believes that the main risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario regarding the external from a possible rise in commodity prices regarding the domestic from the cumulative and lagged effects of the financial condition easing and the fiscal and credit impulse over the evolution of domestic taking into account the dynamics of consumption and in the context of the reduction in the idleness margin in the use of production the balance of these influences on the future trajectory of inflation will be crucial for the assessment of the different monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk for both private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that the convergence of inflation towards the targets path observed in continues to be registered in and such whose results have been evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the committee considers that the accommodation of driven by the tightening of financial conditions and the deterioration of the as well as by the contraction of the global shows persistent signs of having been despite the persistence of which should be resolved over towards positive and negative outlooks for the pace of economic under this scenario of which is supported by the data available so monetary policy must ensure inflationary pressures remain in the committee judges given the signs of recovery in domestic resulting in the reduction in the idleness margin of the production as evidenced by indicators of manufacturing capacity utilization and labor and by the recent behavior of inflation the risks to the achievement of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation can under this monetary policy should remain especially vigilant in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer under this regarding the macroeconomic outlook and the inflation the copom has unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the committee will monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to define the next steps in its monetary policy under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a brief domestic demand has largely thanks to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit on its important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and should contribute to consolidating the resumption of activity and to reduce the residual idleness margin of productive the effects of these stimuli should be carefully monitored over time and will be an important part of the context in which future decisions on monetary which must ensure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets path in and will be in the event that the risk profile deteriorates so that it implies changes to the inflation prospective scenario considered this time by the the monetary policy strategy will promptly be adapted to the at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on march for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in down from in increasing by in compared to in the increase in market prices decelerated from in november to in registering increases of in the prices of tradable goods and in the prices of regulated prices grew up from in the diffusion which stood at in averaged in up from the previous market prices increased in down from in a slowdown in to the cooling in the prices of food and from to regulated prices increased up from in all core inflation measures accelerated in and decelerated according to the the core which excludes ten items of household food and rose from in november to in last the indicator totaled down from in considered the smoothed core the monthly change reached in up from in totaling in down from the previous the double weight core increased by in up from the previous totaling an annual increase of in down from in inflation measured by the after reaching in recorded in on a trailing the increased from in october and to in the trajectory in in the behavior of the which showed marked changes in the prices of intermediate goods of raw materials and of final goods falling in the considering the origin of the annual reduction of the reflected the retreat in industrial and agricultural the changed in the year and the incc with the prices of labor force increasing and the ones relative to equipment and services retreating by activity expanded retail after falling in october and growing in recorded monthly increase of in according to seasonally adjusted data by the monthly survey accumulating increase of in the quarter ended in in relation to the one completed in expanded retail sales increased in november accumulating a change in the year through the monthly growth in sales in november led to the occurrence of positive results in seven out of the ten segments with highlights for furniture and among the segments with negative it is worth mentioning the decrease of observed in the sales of other articles of personal and household the development of expanded retail sales in relation to november showed the occurrence of generalized increases in sales in all segments included in the with highlights for vehicles and parts and equipment and office furniture and and pharmaceutical and medical cumulative retail sales in the year through november registered positive results in eight out of the ten sectors with emphasis on the ones related to pharmaceutical and medical equipment and office magazines and

capital goods imports decreased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the december indicator decreased reaching a capital goods production increased in according to seasonally adjusted with emphasis on the increases in the sectors of capital goods for industrial use capital goods for agricultural purposes and construction inputs capital goods production fell by totaling a

decreased in seasonally according to monthly industrial survey physical production in industrial production grew in with an emphasis on the increase observed in the sector of durable consumer in the last twelve industrial production contracted emphasizing the decrease of observed in the production of capital the monthly performance of the industry reflected the marked expansion in the segments of capital and intermediate in contrast to the retreat observed in the production of durable consumer and of consumer cni indicators continued to show industrial production in the in in this considering seasonally adjusted real revenues in the manufacturing industry grew while hours worked and employment increased respectively by and in the year through the same indicators by and the nuci increased by in the month and vehicles production reached thousand units in according to increasing by according to seasonally adjusted vehicles production decreased the production of vehicles and agricultural machinery declined and in sales of vehicles for the domestic market increased in december and in while exports registered variations of and and expectations according to the the consumer confidence

consumer expectations survey carried out by the fgv the icc decreased in seasonally reflecting the decreases of in the current situation index and of in the expectations index the icc increased resulting from the increases of in the isa and of in the according to the fgv manufacturing industry the industrial business confidence index reached points in december a record high recorded since july and higher than the level observed in december the december icei according to the seasonally adjusted resulting from the increases of both for the current situation index and for the and and according to the observed market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment there were thousand formal job cuts in including thousand in the manufacturing industry and thousand in the service in contrast to the net hires of thousand jobs registered in the retail in thousand jobs were created result since of which thousand in the service thousand in the retail thousand in civil construction and thousand in the manufacturing according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in november up from in october and in november the same survey pointed out that average real earnings of employed workers decreased growing by in the year through real payroll increased and in the year through and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in equivalent to of with increase of in the month and of in credit operations increased in the and in the among the which represent a share of in the total of the financial credit operations to individuals increased in the month and in while nonearmarked credit operations to corporate increased and according to the same comparison earmarked credit operations increased in the month and in the average interest rate on credit used as reference for interest declined again in reaching the lowest level since december the average annual rate on credit for individuals reached in down from in the average rate on corporate credit decreased to in down from in the average tenure on credit used as reference for interest increased for the fourth consecutive month in reaching the average tenure of corporate credit operations reached while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety retreated to after remaining stable in for three consecutive delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate decreased reaching and with declined reaching net delinquency rate for retail measured by the was negative in showing that the number of new records was lower than the cancellations in the last the average rate was up from in trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in increasing by compared to in the exports reached and decreasing by and based on the liquidity international which encompass the repurchase lines and borrowing operations in foreign reached billion in recording a billion increase in the under the cash international reserves totaled billion in recording a billion according to the same comparison economy the sustained recovery of the us economic growth and the maintenance of economic vigor presented by the emerging particularly in the bric countries and in southeast are signs of continued global economic recovery in in contrast to this it bears highlighting the evidence of new stagnation in germany and deepening of fiscal difficulties in ireland and as well as weak domestic demand in under this the recovery of international trade has been supported by the chinese economy in the fourth quarter of resumed the annualized quarterly rate of a result that has favored the acceleration of activity in other southeast asian the performance of the chinese economy has impacted commodities particularly which accounts for the change in the behavior of price indices in the euro japan and ipc annual changes and last compared to and in july despite the reversal in the deflationary expectations remain anchored in the where the idleness of production factors remains in these where inflation does not constitute relevant risk in the and monetary authorities have kept interest rates on the other in vigilant to inflationary expectations and speculation in the real state the government initiated a process to reduce liquidity in the financial system through the increase of interest rates as a reference for and and for the first time since the rate of reserve currently at as recognition of the improvement in general conditions in financial the federal reserve announced that it will not renew the agreements on currency swaps established with other central banks during the financial and the european central bank reiterated that it will continue to shorten the maturity of the refinancing by scheduling one last operation for next market and open market operations since the december copom the yield curve slope for and slightly increased for all the release of improved data for economic activity and the labor the announcement of inflation rates and the increase of market projections for gdp growth contributed to this between december and january and rates increased by bps and whereas and rates increased by bps and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on december to on january in its open market the bcb carried between december and january long fixed rate repo borrowing billion for a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in the same the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures from to working days bringing the average daily balance of these borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of tenure liquidity management operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily the average daily balance of these borrowing operations reached billion between december and january up from billion between october and december for the most recent purchase agreements increased with the total stock reaching billion on january up from billion on december considering the average daily balance the main determinant factor of the liquidity expansion in the period was the net redemption of securities by the national between december and january the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached of which billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and the national treasury also carried out purchase auctions of ltn and which reached billion and ipca after recording in reached in as a inflation reached above the one observed in and above the midpoint the inflation increase in reflects the behavior of market which increased and contributed with of the in regulated prices increased compared to in contributing with just for regarding market it bears emphasizing that the change in the prices of tradable goods reached and the one relative to the prices of in the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of continues in high reaching in in the set of available information suggests that prices acceleration in process lead by market may show some in part because services inflation continues at high food prices trajectory performed relevant role for headline in in the first the ipca showed sharp when the prices of food and beverages increased while in the second fourmonth period there was relative when the prices of food and beverages retreated in the last fourmonth monthly inflation recorded high values in all with food and beverages increasing by it bears highlighting that household food price inflation moved from in april to in and reached in according to the same comparison the ipca reached and the recent elevation in food price inflation has partially mirrored domestic and external supply heightened by the high liquidity environment in international financial markets and global demand in line with the evolution of headline each one of the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb has recorded high the smoothed trimmed means core inflation moved from in october to in november and in averaging in in the same the double weight core inflation increased and also averaging in the core inflation by exclusion rose and in the same averaging in in the smoothed trimmed means core double weight core inflation and the core inflation by exclusion increased and the ipca diffusion which had reached in increased to in november and decreased to in with the diffusion index at this evidences support hypothesis of prices the general price index inflation recorded in value below the one registered in november in inflation reached above the level recorded in inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in the year in reflecting the increase of in the industrial ipa and in the agricultural inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in above the registered in the previous according to the same comparison inflation measured by the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased above the recorded in as emphasized in previous copom meeting the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the index of economic activity of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for products taxes it constitutes an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the which had been showing relative with increase between april and august resumed significant growth in september october and november suggesting that the period of most intense cooling of economic activity may have industrial activity has not still shown consistent signs of a new expansion according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output retreaded by in november after a increase in and a decrease between april and the moving average growth reached in the period between august and unchanged relative to the rate registered in the period ended in output increased in november and in on a trailing industrial output expanded for the eighth consecutive recording in unchanged relative to compared to december a record low for industrial production level registered during the crisis recovery up to november totaled this recovery has partially been supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the most important driver in stemmed from capital goods which increased by consumer and intermediate goods production rates were also recording and considering the moving average ended in all categories capital goods production increased while consumer and intermediate goods production grew by it bears highlighting that increase in the capital goods industry activity is the highest among the use not only according to a comparison but also according to the average until november which expanded by compared to the same period of such behavior evidences the robustness in capital goods a relevant factor for economic recovery in the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey decreased from in october to in lower than the observed in november according to observed after reaching in march the observed rate not only retreated significantly until but reached a historical record low for the series begun in march according to the seasonally adjusted the rate in november also reached a new record low for the series measured by the number of employed workers in the metropolitan increased by in october and in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicated growth in formal employment in all months of except for in thousand jobs were compared to the elimination of thousand jobs in december in november thousand jobs were created thousand jobs in november in the million jobs were created million according to the criterion that considers delayed data delivered by the a expansion relative to which represents the best yearly result since the start of the the key driver for employment retreat in december was which contributed with for the monthly in the services sector was the main with of job creation in the real average earnings in november retreated by compared to the historical record registered in october and increased as a real considering real average earnings earned in the six metropolitan expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand according to the retail monthly survey from the expanded retail sales increased in in october and in according to the seasonally adjusted sales increased in after growing in the six previous the average of sales increased in the quarter ended in compared to the quarter ended in out of the ten sectors eight sectors performed positively in the key driver was material and once with in the upcoming the retail sales trajectory should continue to be benefited by governmental real payroll moderate credit expansion and consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in down from in standing close to the levels registered prior to the according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reached in up from in the previous the four use categories consumer goods industry utilization rate retreated reaching for capital goods reaching both in the construction inputs and in the intermediate goods industries the reduction was according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci remained stable at in after reaching in september and in the installed capacity utilization rates have been stable at high the high occupation level reflects the recent expansion in economic whose effects have not been totally offset by the maturity of investment in this the absorption of capital goods resumed growth in november and grew by the average index through november increased by the production of construction inputs and in as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance result totaled billion below the observed in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and compared to in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to external demand explains most of the reduction of the trade the behavior of remittances of profits and which also reflects the growth differential between the brazilian economy and other has been contributing to elevate the current account the period deficit increased from billion in october to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of resulting in a need of foreign funding equivalent to of since the last copom some tendency of global economy recovery has been mainly in the whose domestic demand shows some especially in household the leading indicator published by the organization for economic and development often used for inferences of future behavior of global industrial production for in the third consecutive monthly the disaggregated indicators by country suggest acceleration on the growth pace in the us and and expectation of continued growth in the other except for the euro area in show quite as uncertainties regarding the solvency of some peripheral economies at the same time that the expansion pace remains strong in inflation rates have been very low in countries euro area and in spite of extremely expansionist economic policy both in fiscal and monetary in the twelve months ended in core inflation rates which excludes food and energy products reached only in the in the euro area and in since the last there was monetary tightening in several as in the bank of china in january this the fourth increase in reserve requirements since november last brent oil prices increased substantially since the last copom reaching a level close to this acceleration is consistent with apparent strengthening in the global demand framework given that empiric evidences suggest that international oil in the last two have been determined more due to the global demand conditions than by the supply it bears highlighting oil prices a result of low predictability of some global demand of dependency of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and of geopolitical complexity that is typical to the the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in regarding the prices of other it is noteworthy the increase in the agricultural international the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and which considers reached its peak in december this movement was among other by the increase in the international prices of cereals and vegetable in recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices seems to have been strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to the remarkable volatility in fx of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline an bottled gas prices in were kept unchanged at the same considered at the december copom the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity rates in were kept at and the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual according to the benchmark was kept at unchanged relative to the december this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total december the projection for regulated prices inflation in according to the benchmark was kept at such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of without in to parameters contained in the budget guidelines a primary surplus of is considered for the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements measures announced in since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations remained unchanged at the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the december copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin at the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projection stands above the midpoint target in the benchmark scenario and around the target in the market policy decision the assessment is that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic mainly price it is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation target regime stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the fx and the inflationary risk premiums among other seem to have determined in significant reduction of the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has increased in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy in international volatility and risk aversion have remained high since the last copom partially fueled by the extraordinary levels of global liquidity and by the prospects that this process can eventually concerns about european sovereign and banking debts and the possible deceleration in china have remained at the same time that the confidence in the sustainability of the us economy recovery prices of relevant commodities without in the opposite of domestic assets in the prospects for external funding of brazilian economy remain the trajectory of prices indices shows the increase of inflationary pressures in some relevant whereas concerns regarding the prospects of deflation in other economies tend to the copom evaluates that domestic economy activity prospects are favorable in this and in the upcoming this assessment is supported by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to despite at a moderate both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor mirrored in the historical low unemployment rates and substantial growth of real particularly in the public the copom evaluates that the development of the inflation prospective scenario developed unfavorably since the last in in the last quarter of inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by the dynamics of food which in part reflected domestic and external supply these developments tend to be transmitted to the prospective among other through as pointed by the figures considered by the committee in its inflation as well as market analysts the committee considers relevant the risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth it is also noteworthy the narrow margin in production factors especially in labor under such a relevant risk is posed by the possibility of concession of nominal wages increase incompatible with productivity the prospective scenario considers the seasonal aspect of inflation in the first as well as the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments foreseen to be implemented in this for the year as a the behavior of these items tend to be relatively the benchmark scenario also considers the potential negative impact stemming from extremely adverse weather conditions observed in the beginning of this year in some regions of the although it attributes significant probability to the hypotheses at least in this process may be reverted during the the copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation besides contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend in the public the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit for which the macroprudential actions recently adopted the committee considers in such regulatory changes should materialize as an element of aggregate demand constraint through the credit as well as by the reduction of incentives to the adoption of strategies such as the simple broadening of contract among the available information confirm this by evidencing relevant impacts both in prices and in volume of goods traded in the credit it is plausible to affirm that the current regulatory compared to the previous tends to heighten the impacts of conventional monetary policy in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which an uncertainty level and identifies increasing risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation promptly converges to the midpoint since the last copom at the external the extraordinary liquidity the introduction of new fiscal stimuli in the us and respective asset price spillovers have pointed to lower probability of reversion in the recovery process experienced by the from another they reveal the still ambiguous influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation regarding the domestic the recently announced macroprudential a fast and powerful tool to contain local demand will still have their effects incorporated to price since the last the materialization of short term risks which the copom considered at that opportunity has also although uncertainties that surround the global outlook at a minor the domestic do not allow the clear identification the degree of permanence of recent the committee evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario evolved in this the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without starting a process of adjustment of the basic interest whose combined to those stemming from macroprudential will contribute to inflation convergence towards the target domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although tending to cool fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in the last and should still contribute for the activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness level of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial by the not yet very favorable prospects for global economy by recent macroprudential these elements and the developments in the fiscal outlook are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on march for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in down from in totaling in the highest annual rate since and above the market prices inflation retreated from in november to in with emphasis in the reduction from to in tradable favored by the deceleration of the increases in the prices of products prices increased up from in with highlights for the prices of regulated prices increased by down from in the diffusion index reached down from in averaging in up from in the previous market prices increased in up from in while regulated prices recorded and market prices performance reflected the increased in tradable from to and from to driven by the increase in the prices of food and which had reached in services inflation increased up from in the previous the smoothed core ipca inflation increased in down from in totaling in the compared to in the core inflation by exclusion that excludes ten items of household food and vehicles fuels rose in up from in totaling in the up from in the core inflation by exclusion that excludes the whole food and beverages group grew in the compared to in reaching in the down from in highlighting that this stability indicates the impact caused by the food group in the ipca acceleration in the double weight core inflation rose in up from in reaching in the up from in the increased in down from in reaching in the compared to a reduction in highlighting that the monthly rate resulted from a slowdown in the ipa and in the ipc rates and acceleration in the incc the ipa rose in the down from in mainly influenced by the monthly downward change from to in agricultural driven by the reduction of and in the prices of beans and and by the deceleration in the price increase of corn and the industrial products prices decreased from to driven by the retreat in the prices of meat products and the ipa grew in up from in due to the increases of in agricultural products and in industrial the favored by the deceleration in the prices increase of mainly increased in down from in reaching in the up from in the incc grew in up from in highlighting that the increase in the compared to in was especially related to the increase in labor force activity the increased in the sixth consecutive monthly according to seasonally adjusted for the quarter ended in the increased by relative to the quarter ended in which had recorded according to the same comparison according to the observed the increased in accumulating in the year and in the last twelve expanded retail sales increased in according to data seasonally adjusted by the monthly survey contributing to the increase in the average of the quarter ended in november compared to

consumer goods segment vehicles production reached thousand units in increasing according to data released by the anfavea and seasonally adjusted by the the sector production expanded totaling a increase in the year through compared to the same period of vehicles sales increased in december and the change was due to the increase in domestic sales and in while the interannual result stemmed from changes of and in the same the sector sales increased in as domestic sales increased and the third prognosis carried out by the ibge in december for the harvest estimated million tons of legumes

twelve days for tenures related to individuals and corporate which reached days and delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety remained stable at in delinquency rates for credit operations with individuals reduced to and the one relative to corporate increased by to environment although the prospects for developed economies to enter new recessive period have strongly decreased since the last copom the risks associated to the evolution of a benign scenario for the global economic activity remain in special those associated to the fiscal crisis in some euro area in the the current prospects consider better domestic demand mainly in an environment of reduction of uncertainties associated to employment and the recent extension of tax fiscal law in the which included reduction in taxes levied on contributes for this favorable commodities international prices registered strong increase in the last months of in some cases exceeding the record highs reached in heightened by actions in financial the occurrence of adverse weather conditions and consumption strengthening worldwide were the main drivers of that in the performance of agricultural commodities prices trend was highly impacted by the deterioration of supply conditions in several reflecting the climate impact caused by la niña in the financial the main stock market indices have registered gains since the last copom influenced by economic in an environment of abundant december inflation indices captured the trajectory of commodities prices annual cpi in the euro indonesia and russia reached and in compared to and in this trend in emerging increases in the prices of agricultural domestic demand strengthening and product gap reduction in their while in the us and in the euro december hikes are mainly associated to increases in energy it bears emphasizing in these evidencing the scenario of low level installed capacity utilization and high unemployment inflationary pressures continue to be in and cpi core annual in the us and in the euro in this the central banks in the us and euro area maintained the accommodative stance of their choosing by keeping their respective basic interest rates being followed by the uk and japan central it bears highlighting since the last copom several central among which the ones from korea and have increased their respective basic interest on january the bank of china announced new increase in reserve the fourth rise since november last trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in the highest monthly surplus in the contributing for the annual result of exports reached new monthly historical high of billion and imports totaled on a daily average the trade surplus fell by recording growth of in imports and in international reserves reached billion in increasing billion compared to november and billion in the the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic in the accumulating billion in the market and open market operations since the last copom in the futures interest rate yield curve shifted upwards for all this movement was influenced by several among which the release of high current inflation different core the upward trajectory of commodities prices in the international and uncertainties related to the implementation of the fiscal adjustment announced by the for the short term the market prospects regarding the start of a new cycle of basic interest rate increase also contributed for the upward movement in the between december and january and interest rates increased and and interest rates increased and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on december to on january on january the central bank carried out reverse exchange rate swap in which it assumed long fx position and short interest rate this operation totaled the equivalent to in its open market the bcb carried between december and january repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between thirteen and thirty working increasing the average daily balance of shortterm borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of tenure liquidity management the very shortterm including the tenure liquidity management averaged a daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreements of the central bank decreased from billion between october and december to between december and january considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was an increase in the daily balance of repurchase agreements totaling elevating the total stock from billion on december to billion on january the main driver of liquidity expansion in the period was the net redemption of securities by the national between december and january the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of inflationlinked reached for securities maturing in and monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index reached in percentage points above the one recorded in the previous as a inflation accumulated in months reached in may in may with market prices increasing by in may and regulated in may specifically regarding market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months through may in may and the prices of in may it bears noticing that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in twelve months through may in may and the prices of services rose in may in available information partially reflects the more persistent dynamics of prices in the services sector but already showing some deceleration the realignment process of relative prices and temporary supply shocks in the food and beverages the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in april to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in may the double weight core inflation changed from in april to in the trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to the smoothed trimmed means ipca core from to the core inflation by exclusion of ten household food as well as changed from to and the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household food changed from to the diffusion index stood at in may below the one recorded in may the general price index increased in reaching on a trailing basis in may the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months through may in may with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in the same period in may the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in may with the labor costs growing in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics decreased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in march the decreased and seasonally the composite purchasing index regarding reached in may the lowest level in this survey after seasonal indicating strong contraction in the private sector the industry confidence index the services confidence index and the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation increased and between april and regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the projects a decrease of in the grains production in relative to the the gross domestic product at market prices fell in the first quarter of after falling by in the last quarter of according to data seasonally adjusted by the there was a retraction of in the first quarter of after decreasing by in the last quarter of from the aggregate demand household consumption decreased by according to seasonally adjusted and over the same quarter of on its government consumption increased at but decreased the gross fixed capital formation decreased by and over the first quarter the industrial activity remained stable in increasing according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the the industrial production accumulates a change of in the last twelve months through april according to the observed the industrial production decreased in with negative results in three of the four use categories and in out of the surveyed according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry decreased in april according to the seasonally adjusted and it stands at a level lower than the one registered in april the pmi of the industrial on its decreased from in april to in the lowest level since the pointing to strong which is confirmed by the retraction observed in the investment goods among the use comparing the april and march according to the seasonally adjusted data durable consumer goods and semi and goods registered on the other capital goods and intermediate goods registered expansion in the regarding there was a decrease in the production in three of the four durable consumer goods capital goods intermediate goods and semi and nondurable consumer goods according to the continuous national household sample survey the unemployment rate in the moving quarter ended in april was estimated at an increase of compared to the same period last data released by the ministry of labor and social security showed reduction of thousand formal jobs in while million formal jobs were closed in the last twelve in the set of available data confirm intensification of the process of distension in the labor according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume decreased in on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction decreased in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted with retraction in eight of the ten sectors in twelve the retail sales volume fell by and the broad retail sales volume decreased the trade confidence index measured by the increased in and reached the highest level since june the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in may according to the seasonally adjusted among the industry use according to the seasonally adjusted the ones showing the highest nuci are consumer goods and consumer goods followed by intermediate goods durable consumer goods and capital goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through according to the ministry of industry and foreign trade the trailing trade balance surplus reached billion in may this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with retreats of and relative to the cumulative results through may on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in april equivalent to of the foreign direct investment to the direct investment liabilities totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators point to moderation trend in the horizon relevant for the monetary with growth rates relatively more homogeneous in advanced despite being low and below potential particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements restraining investments and in the united the trend is of economic some cooling in the dynamics of growth is in the emerging the activity pace has been constantly revised in a scenario surrounded by uncertainties regarding the loss of strength in china and their implications for the global regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging reinforced by signs of a more gradual process of normalization of monetary conditions in the the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced economies and relatively high in the emerging the price of the brent oil barrel increased since the previous copom reaching levels around it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some components of global accentuated by the effects of the slowdown of the chinese and of influenced by the reduction of investments in the production since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have increased and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through may of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected change is in unchanged relative to the april copom among other this projection considers average increase of in the water and sewage of in the prices of health plans and reduction of in electricity for an increase of is unchanged relative to the value projected at the last three the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the trajectories of primary deficits set at of the gdp for at of the gdp for according to the project of change in the ldo guidelines and to the pldo budgetary guidelines it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural result in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for it reduced from to the baseline scenario considers the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the inflation projection for compared to the value considered at the previous copom increased and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council on its the inflation projection for in the baseline fell to the midpoint target established by the according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom the inflation projection for increased compared to the value considered at the april the inflation projection for on its reduced relative to the projection considered at the previous both for and for the projections stand above the inflation policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to the projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the committee considers that the external environment remains especially despite the occurrence of episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging the committee also identifies low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial for the global activity tends to grow more slowly throughout the monetary policy relevant recent prospects indicate modest activity recovery in the advanced while important emerging economies experience a transition in this of reduction in the activity it bears highlighting the ongoing concern regarding the chinese economy and its developments over other coupled with the uncertainties regarding the us economy still regarding international financial the copom highlights moderation in the dynamics of commodities despite some recent regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic gasoline the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy through productive such as the in it should be noted the increased uncertainty generated by low oil prices and their implications for oil companies and producing as well as for financial markets in with risks to global financial the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that domestic absorption and gdp growth rates continue to indicating low domestic activity expansion pace this this process has been especially intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of in investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of these and private consumption also in line with employment and income for the after a necessary period of which has been more intense and longer than as and confidence the activity pace tends to the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the aggregate supply and demand consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain these coupled with other ones currently anticipate an aggregate demand growth composition in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the depreciation of the brl contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economic regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of agriculture and livestock the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance in addition to the reduction of uncertainties surrounding the domestic and international it is worth mentioning the importance of ensuring a primary trajectory that enables stabilization and further reduction of public debt to gdp which is a crucial measure to reinforce the positive perception regarding the economic to improve the confidence of agents and to contribute to the anchoring of inflation the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the recently assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers that the balance of the public sector stands in expansionary the committee hightlights that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary as well as in its impact the hypotheses considered for inflation concerning inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow the monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario considers credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong consumer credit has so over the last there on the one exposure reduction by banks on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by actions that have been the committee considers as opportune to continue to reinforce the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit in the as anticipated by previous the copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market is with data confirming the acceleration of the expected distension in this a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of high nominal with negative impacts over in spite of the recent occurrence of real wage changes consistent with the estimates for the labor productivity the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating cost inflationary the copom considers that the still elevated inflation level reflects the relative prices adjustment processes occurred in as well as the recovery process of the fiscal revenues observed at the federal and state at the start of the in addition to the temporary supply shocks in the food and which cause inflation to show although the committee recognizes that these processes have direct impact on it reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the effects stemming from the committee recognizes the progress in disinflation especially the containment of effects stemming from relative price it considers that the high level of inflation in twelve months and the distance between inflation expectations and the inflation targeting regime objectives do not allow monetary policy the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz edson otávio ribeiro sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its net exports show better either by increasing benefited by the depreciation of the or by the ongoing import substitution for the the combined effects of these the developments in the fiscal and quasi fiscal framework and in the assets in this the dynamics of regulated the distension process in the labor market and an output gap more disinflationary than the initially anticipated are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by the in despite advances in the inflation the committee emphasizes that there are uncertainties associated with the balance of notably related to the gradual process of recovery of fiscal and that the relative price realignment process has taken longer and has been more intense than the the uncertainties regarding the behavior of the global economy in this the committee reaffirms that it will take the necessary measures in order to ensure the compliance with the objectives of the targeting which means to circumscribe inflation to the limits established by the in and to make inflation converge to the in in this it points out that the central scenario does not allow considering the hypothesis of easing the monetary at the end of the it was registered that the committee will reconvene on july for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june after recording in monthly inflation measured by ipca reached in as a inflation through july reached in above inflation registered in the twelve months through june the inflation elevation in this period reflected the behavior of both market which increased in the same period of and regulated which increased in the same period of regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached in the same period of while inflation related to nontradable goods increased in the same period of it should be in another perspective that the change through july of the durable goods prices stood at of the goods at and of the nondurable goods at despite the moderation at the services price inflation continues at high with monthly growth of in down from in in the twelvemonth period through july services inflation reached the highest level since september in the set of available information suggests persistence in the price increase observed in process led by market in reflects the fact that services inflation remains at high the underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb performed similarly to headline while the inflation through july the average of the monthly rates retreated between may and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased to in from in june and in while the trimmed means core inflation increased to in from in june and in the double weight core after registering in decreased to in june and to in at the same core inflation by which excludes items of food at home and totaled in down from in june and in while core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and of household food at home changed from to and in the same the average change of these five core measures retreated to in down from in june and in in the period up to the five core measures registered and compared to and in and and in the general price index inflation registered deflation of in july and of in compared to inflation of in in the period through the variation of this index reached up from in july note under this the index has been slowing down since december when it recorded inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in twelve months through reflecting an increase of in the industrial ipa and of in the agricultural the breakdown according to the production phase shows that raw material prices accumulated while the prices of intermediate goods and final goods increased and following the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through july above the recorded until july according to the same comparison the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in july the producer price industry calculated by the which measures the industry price level excluding freights and registered deflation in compared to a fall of in may and an increase of in in twelve the variation of this index decreased to in from in the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the declined in after registering stability in may and an increase of in as the index increased in compared to the previous down from increase in for the accumulated in twelve the moderation in the growth rate trend reducing to in from in the services confidence index from increased in after two equal and consecutive falls in may and the level of the indicator in july stood above that measured in july and relatively stable compared to the average level of industrial activity showed expansion in with a increase in the industrial according to data seasonally adjusted by the after recording a decrease of in june and an of in the moving average growth rate reached in the period from may to after a decline of in the period from april to industrial output decreased in while in the period there was an increase of compared to in continuing the process of growth since december month with the lowest output level during the the accumulated growth until july was among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital goods and durable consumer goods increased in and whereas the production of and consumer goods increased in the production of intermediate there was a decline of in the twelve months through july intermediate goods output increased durable consumer goods output grew and and consumer goods output increased according to the same comparison capital goods industry activity growth is the highest among use recording an the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed decreased to in down from in compared to the level registered in july after reaching in march the observed data not only significantly reduced until july but reached a record low for the month since the start of the series in march the seasonally adjusted rate registered in a decrease compared to measured by the number of employed workers in the six main metropolitan increased in after an expansion of in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that in july thousand jobs were created thousand in july with expansion of formal jobs in all the eight sectors of economic services and retail were the sectors that mostly contributed for the formal employment increase in according to real average earnings observed in july increased and as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in the payroll expansion is an important factor in sustaining growth in domestic according to the retail monthly survey from expanded retail sales increased in after recording growth in may and in according to the same comparison according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales showed increase of in after expanding in may and in the accumulated growth rate reached in up from in may and in in the last twelve months through all ten sectors surveyed showed growth in sales with highlights in terms of for equipment and office computer and communication furniture and appliances motorcycles and parts and construction inputs in the next the retail trajectory will continue to be benefited by governmental by the pace of growth of real by the consumer confidence and by credit with the perspective of the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal kept unchanged in in capacity utilization was and lower than the ones observed in july and august according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci fell from to in the lowest level since november capacity utilization is higher in the construction inputs sector and intermediate goods in the sector of capital the nuci stood at while in the sector of consumer goods it stood at according to the confederation of national industry seasonally adjusted by the the nuci decreased from in may to in though they remain at high rates of capacity utilization have shown a downward trend at the in the maturation process of in the absorption of capital goods grew by in the last twelve months through while production of construction inputs for the civil construction grew by the trade balance surplus in the last twelve months increased from billion in june to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the last twelve months through the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months fell from billion in june to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding the needs for external global economy faces period of high with deterioration in the prospects for short and medium term in the advanced countries and some activity moderation in emerging the risks to global financial stability among by the possible exposure of international banks to sovereign especially in the euro the uncertainties were since the last copom in part due to the united sovereign debt rating it should be noted that the risk aversion levels for measured by spreads and implied volatilities in equity bonds and currencies already exceed those achieved in from another high rates of unemployment for a long coupled with the need for fiscal and limited scope for monetary policy have contributed to revisions for growth projections in the advanced countries or even for its potential indicating a wider and more volatile business in the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for showed strong signs of inflection in the main with lower growth prospects in the coming disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for july and august related to the activity in industry and services sector are consistent with this suggesting stagnation in the united states france and and contraction the rest of the euro regarding monetary the mature economies continued to adopt accommodative monetary about the core measures persist at moderate levels in the euro zone and with the euro zone showing an increase in core inflation in july and a fall compared to june in spite of still widespread inflationary pressures in emerging there was discontinuity of monetary tightening oil prices as defined by the brent blend have shown volatility and remains above this price level is consistent with a framework of global demand coupled with high political instability in producer countries and lags in the process of resuming it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten price which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the increase in international prices of agricultural and reduction in metallic commodities after successive months with significant despite the strong correction in risky assets the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers has presented some but remains at high in recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to fx markets of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline prices accumulated in remained at considered in the july copom partial reversal of the increase occurred up to the adjustments for bottled gas for the same were kept unchanged at the projected adjustment for fixed telephone and electricity accumulated in were kept unchanged at and the same values considered in the july the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark increased to up from considered in the july this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total july the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark were kept unchanged at value considered in the july such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the new public sector primary surplus around of without in a primary surplus of around of gdp is considered for and without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements changes announced in december since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca were kept unchanged at for the median of inflation expectations were kept unchanged at specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians for the ipca changed from and to and for the medians changed from and to and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relatively to the figure considered at the july copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projection fell in both the benchmark and the market positioned around the midpoint of the target in both for the projected inflation fell in the benchmark and remained stable in the market positioned around the midpoint of the target in both an alternative scenario built and analyzed from the perspective of a medium sized dynamic stochastic general equilibrium considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will make an impact on the brazilian economy equivalent to one quarter of the impact observed during the international crisis of it assumes that the current deterioration of the international scenario is more persistent than the one verified in but less without observance of extreme in this alternative the domestic economic activity slows down although there is depreciation of the exchange rate and reduction of the basic interest among the inflation rate stands at a level below what would be observed if it were not considered the above mentioned effect of international policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the inflation targeting regime maturing process stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the reduction of both fx and inflationary risk among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has been increasing in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the monetary policy traction increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy reassessing the international the committee considers that there has been substantial deterioration since the last for in generalized and significant growth projections reductions for the main economic the committee believes that there are higher chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed can extend over a longer than anticipated period of note that in these there seems to be limited scope for using monetary and a scenario of fiscal restraint also the committee considers that the international scenario manifests disinflationary bias for the relevant for the the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy can be realized through many among the reduction of total trade the moderation in the investment tighter credit conditions and the worsening in consumer and business the committee understands that the complexity surrounding the international environment will help to intensify and accelerate the ongoing moderation in domestic which is already for in the retreat of the growth projections for the brazilian in other the ongoing moderation process in the economy a result of policy actions implemented since the end of last year tends to be boosted by the weakness of the global as a the balance of risks for inflation becomes more the copom evaluates although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is prospects for economic activity are still this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stand at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and substantial wages the copom evaluates that since the last meeting the inflation prospective scenario shows more favorable in the last quarter of and in the first quarter of inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply evidences suggest that consumer prices have already incorporated the direct effects of these also relevant were the direct effects of the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments in the first quarter of the in specific shows signs of the committee considers that these effects shall still impact indirectly consumer prices among other through at the same it as despite on a decreasing the risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin of the production especially labor and analyzes in such a very important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the nuci has retreated and it is below its to the opening of the output gap and to contain price at the end of last year and at the start of this the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory in international markets were key to the prospective since april these prices have shown some the copom foresees that the inflation upward cycle ends this from the fourth quarter the main scenario indicates a downward trend for the accumulated inflation which will start to move toward the the copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the trend in the reduction of the public it bears highlighting since the beginning of this important decisions have been taken and which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is regarding this according the evaluation of the the recent revision of the fiscal policy scenario makes the balance of risks for inflation more the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit for which macroprudential and conventional monetary policy actions recently adopted still about this the committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies regarding credit in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which an increasing and uncertainty level and identifies decreasing risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation timely converges to the midpoint in other the committee evaluates that since the last the inflation prospective scenario has shown more favorable the copom unanimously recognizes that the macroeconomic environment has changed substantially since its last meeting in such a way that a reassessment and possibly a reverse in the recent process of the basic interest rate hike are two members of the committee have assessed that the current situation does not yet offer all the necessary conditions to begin this movement in this the copom decided to decrease the selic target to without by five votes in favor of the monetary policy and by two votes for the maintenance of the selic rate at domestic demand is still largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector also seen as important curbing factors to domestic demand are the substantial deterioration of the international scenario and the macroprudential actions these elements and the quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the monetary policy committee believes that by promptly mitigating the effects from a more restrictive global moderate adjustments in the level of the basic rate are consistent with the scenario of inflation convergence to the target in at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on october for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in up from in according to ibge in the the ipca reached compared to in the same period of last in the last twelve months through the index changed compared to in the growth in market prices declined from in june to in reflecting the slowdown both in the prices of from to and in the prices of from to in the same the segment of regulated prices changed by in from reduction of in emphasizing the highs of in the prices of interstate and of in health the monthly change of ipca in particular the contributions of the transport personal and health and personal both of the diffusion index stood at in against in market prices increased in the last twelve months through up from in while regulated prices showed deceleration to down from for the same among market the price change in twelve months of tradable goods accelerated from through june to through while the variation of goods accelerated from to the prices of the services which present higher degree of increased in up from in june and in july the totaled in after recording in accumulating in the year and in twelve months up to compared to in twelve months up to according to in the the result reflected the negative changes in the ipc and and the acceleration in the the ipa totaled in after recording in totaling in the year and in twelve the prices of agricultural and livestock products changed in after recording in totaling in the year and in the twelve months through the prices of industrial products decreased in the down from in totaling in the year and in twelve regarding agricultural and livestock the monthly retreat was more strongly influenced by the falls of in the price of of in the price of cotton and of in the price of which exerted negative contribution of and the main negative contributions to the change of industrial prices came from the item chemical and metallic the ipc changed in after decreasing in accumulating in the year and in twelve in the food and reading and leisure groups were the ones responsible for the decrease of the contributing and the incc changed in the compared to in as a consequence of the acceleration of labor force in july from in and decelerating of equipment and services from according to the same comparison the incc accumulated changes of in the year and of in twelve months up to the five ipca core inflation measures calculated by the bcb decelerated in the twelve months ending in against the twelve months through the core inflation by which excludes ten items of household food and increased in down from in accumulating in twelve months through down from

increases of in the year and of in the period ended in june in the previous the monthly result was influenced by the prices decreases of food products metallurgy and computer electronics and with respective contributions of and in the the index change reflected specially the decrease in the segments food prices and computer electronics and which contributed and for the final the commodities index brazil dropped for the fourth consecutive month in with a variation of reflecting the changes of and in the relating to agricultural and metal and energy in the year up to the index decreased whereas in twelve months the index increased activity the decreased in accumulating growth in the compared to the when it had grown in the same comparison considering seasonally adjusted the increased compared to june accumulating increases of in the year and in twelve expanded retail which include vehicles and construction grew in june according to data seasonally adjusted from monthly survey after increasing in may and in in the five out of the ten surveyed segments presented with highlights for the expansion of in computing and communication equipment and material and for the contraction of in vehicles and parts and expanded retail sales grew in the compared to the previous retail sales volume increased in compared to the previous according to seasonally adjusted after increasing in may and decreasing in resulting in quarterly average increase in compared to the previous considering observed expanded retail sales increased in mainly influenced by the increases in the sales of computing and communication equipment and in furniture and house in construction in parts and in twelve months up to expanded retail sales increased due to the sales increase in some such as computing

debt ceiling in the us economy and its later downgrade by a rating agency and the worsening for economic slowdown expectations for these two economies and their effects on the global in this the financial markets operated under extreme with a significant increase in risk economic activity in major developed economies shows evident signs of in the despite the annualized quarterly change of gdp for had increased to compared to in data of gdp of household consumption recorded respective increases of and over the same latest and high frequency indicators reinforce the deteriorating prospects for us economic the unemployment rate remains at a high in while the index of consumer measured by the university of reached points in the second lowest level in approaching points recorded in november in the purchasing managers index of manufacturing fell to points in down from points in the previous signaling a strong slowdown in manufacturing in the euro the annualized quarterly change of gdp reached in from in the previous highlighting the decline of to observed in the variation of this indicator to preliminary estimates for to the august consumer confidence calculated by the european commission and the manufacturing pmi suggests that economic activity remains weakening in the euro in although the gdp registered a third consecutive negative quarterly more recent indicators indicate that economic activity is driven on by the supply the relaxation of restrictions caused by the earthquake and ensuing tsunami in investments should gradually mainly due to the reconstruction of affected and private although it has not returned to also shows signs of in domestic demand remains and industrial in a slight keep on monthly expansion around the indicators suggest that the slowdown is not likely to be in a very uncertain financial markets operated under extreme with flight to to assets considered this was reflected in significant losses in equity notably in the financial increase in the demand for us treasury and as a the treasuries reached the lowest earnings for the last sixty in sharp appreciation of and intensified appreciation of the yen and swiss franc against the the international commodity prices were highly with devaluations in the sectors of energy and metal whose prices are more sensitive to economic whereas the prices of agricultural commodities recorded influenced by the deterioration of the supply reflecting less favorable climate conditions in producing areas and partial results of the harvest of some indicating a lower than expected the less favorable outlook for global economic activity is not yet reflected in consumer price index which followed under pressure in the uk and the euro with respective annual variations in of and in the same the annual change of ipcs in china reached and in in meetings held in the and the uk central banks have maintained their interest rates the bank of japan raised its program to purchase asset from trillion to and the federal reserve announced the likely maintenance of the fed funds rate at exceptionally low levels until at least between and since the last copom the central banks of switzerland and turkey announced reductions in their basic interest trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in exports reached billion and in the the trade surplus totaled above the registered in according to the daily average reflecting expansions of in exports and in in the total trade grew totaling compared to billion in the same period of international reserves reached billion in increasing billion compared to june and billion compared to december the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic spot market in the market and open market operations since the last copom in the domestic interest rate yield curve decreased in all its especially in intermediate and long which led to the complete reversal of his inclination to this movement was influenced mainly by expectations of slowing global due to the worsening of indicators of activity and employment in the united the downgrade of the us credit the sign given by the fed keeping low interest rates until and the uncertainties related to the highly indebt countries in the euro in the domestic the disclosure of activity indicators below expectations and the announcement of additional fiscal effort in also contributed to the fall in interest between july and august and interest rates decreased and while and rates and real interest measured by the ratio between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation retreated from on july to on august following the decline of nominal in july the central bank carried out reverse exchange rate swap auction directed to the rollover of the contracts due on august this operation totaled the equivalent to million in notional in its open market the bcb carried between july and august repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations increased to in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between thirteen and thirty working decreasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through very these operations had average daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreements of the central bank increased from billion between june and july to between july and august considering the operations for the most recent there was a decrease in the daily balance of repurchase agreements of resulting in stock decrease from billion in july to billion in august the main drivers of liquidity contraction in the period were the net revenues of the central government and the issuance of net securities by the national treasury between july and august the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in issuance of reached for securities maturing in and ipca inflation retreated in july and to and down from in as a inflation reached in the first eight months of the highest in the period since up from in the same period of trailing inflation showed the first deceleration since october in after reaching in it totaled in july and in august to in the same month of under this comparison the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which increased more rapidly than regulated market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through compared to and in the twelve months through august despite the brl the prices of tradable goods reaching to in august according to the same comparison regarding the prices of greatly pressured by the behavior of perishable food and services trailing inflation was even higher evidencing the influence of domestic factors over inflationary for the price of services increased in august up from in december and in august according to the same comparison preliminary data for september point to consumer inflation index similar to that observed in despite higher than the september in despite some improvement in the inflationary dynamics at the the reversal of the progressive divergence of inflation from the targets which had been observed since the end of consolidated the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb have evolved in line with the headline notwithstanding the the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated the smoothed trimmed means core inflation and the trimmed means core inflation measures changed from and in to and in and to and in similarly to the headline the three core inflation measures remarkably accelerated in the first eight months of the compared to the same period of with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and nonsmoothed trimmed means core on a trailing the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices continues to record substantial rising from in june to in july and in on the other the smoothed and trimmed means core inflation have shown relative under this in the last the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in june to in july and in whereas the nonsmoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in june to in july and in as a all core inflation measures stand above the central value for the inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion whose average is the highest recorded since continues to suggest dissemination of the inflationary confirming the analysis present in previous copom the general price index inflation decelerated to in august first monthly deflation since march down from in and in on a trailing inflation increased in up from in but retreated to in up from in august in the twelve months through the increase reflected the behavior of the three main the consumer price increased in august while the wholesale price index totaled in august according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in august regarding the agricultural inflation reached in the twelve months through august it also bears highlighting the continuity of upward pressures over wholesale industrial a process that began in the second half of and does not show consistent signs of in the first eight months of wholesale industrial price inflation increased up from in the same period of in in the last twelve wholesale industrial price inflation increased in up from in december as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation after the last copom the ibge released data for second quarter data showed sustainable robust growth both for accumulated results in the year up from in the previous and for results as against in the previous on the aggregate demand it bears emphasizing the strength of gross fixed capital which grew by in the second quarter of the expansion of household which tends to be less volatile than investment along the has also been according to the same comparison as a the contribution of domestic absorption for gdp growth remained around in line with the observed in the first quarter of the and well above the contribution observed at the end of on the aggregate supply industrial production expanded by led by the growth in the manufacturing industry and growth in the civil construction in the second quarter of the great highlight was the expansion in the agribusiness the change of gdp deflator at market prices accelerated from in the first quarter of the to in the second in line with the inflationary acceleration observed in the on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after growing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the expansion observed in industrial output increased by in partially reflecting the unusual working day distribution observed this it bears noticing that general industrial output grew in the year through with respective increases of and in manufacturing and in mining on a industrial output expanded by in july one more working the same growth recorded in manufacturing and extraction the data already released for the last months in to the continuity of the industrial production expansion despite some accommodation at the margin may due to restrictions to supply expansion in some as well as to the effects of the monetary policy change in brazil and to the deceleration of external among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital goods production increased in regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased and consumer goods production remained stable and durable consumer goods production retreated by in the capital goods production leads the with an followed by the elevation in durable consumer goods the recovery of the capital goods production in june and july more than offset the strong fall occurred in evidencing the strength of this which has been mainly a result of the consolidation of favorable prospects for the continuity of macroeconomic on its the expansion of durable goods production credit which remain more favorable than historical labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey reached in a but below july as a the average unemployment rate in the first seven months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate reached in july up from in showing stability in historically low levels in the last the nominal average earnings increased in led by public sector a record high for the series since december in real average earnings increased and in the first seven months of real average earnings increased while employment grew as a real payrolls expanded by growth in july in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in july to in june and in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in july to in june and in in manufacturing employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment this with the creation of thousand jobs in june and thousand jobs in a record high for the monthly historical in july result corresponds to a increase in the first seven months of the employment reached a record high of thousand above the previous record high observed for the historical series in an evidence of the labor market formal employment by in seasonally and observed data point to a expansion in formal employment in the last twelve the services sector presented the highest hiring rate in with the creation of thousand new the second best result of the series for the followed by the agricultural sector thousand new also the second best result of the series for the the manufacturing industry recorded thousand new up from thousand in july whereas the retail sector recorded thousand new jobs thousand in july and the civil construction recorded thousand new jobs thousand in july in addition to the process of formalization in the labor these data evidence the strong dynamism in labor force in formal employment grew by in the year through in line with the positive developments in the labor market and with credit retail sales still continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and signs of cooling cannot be according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales grew by in after increasing in may and in and grew by in june and in the first half of expanded retail sales moving average increased in representing the consecutive monthly according to seasonally adjusted on a it bears emphasizing the expansion in and parts and and clothing and in the year through cumulative growth was more significant in computing and communication material and parts and and personal and domestic despite the rise in food and supermarket food beverages and tobacco showed a significant under the same comparison the steady growth of retail sales reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit for the next the continuity of the current expansion cycle of retail sales is favored by the increase in fiscal employment and income credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high as time goes the change in the monetary policy stance will be relevant to restrain the retail sales expansion the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in up from in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing which had retreated in resumed growth in june and reaching a record high in july for the observed series without the seasonal the nuci stood above the same level registered in july as a the average rate in the first seven months of was above the level observed in the same period of the monthly nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas reached in according to the observed standing above the level registered in the same month of the elevation in the nuci in august is also observed in the production of civil construction inputs of consumer goods and of capital goods for the intermediate goods the nuci stood below the level observed in august the maintenance of installed capacity utilization rates at historically high levels occurs in several sectors despite investments occurred in the sector in the last twelve in recent data about the absorption of capital goods still allow the conclusion of inflexion in the investment expansion capital goods production increased by in june and in after a fall observed in capital goods in changed and in june and whereas capital goods exports changed and in the same according to seasonally adjusted the absorption of capital goods increased in the quarter ended in accumulating a expansion in in the same the production of civil construction inputs increased by in in evidences suggest although investment has been importantly contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization the maturation of investment projects has not been so to significantly limit the existing mismatches regarding the evolution of supply and domestic as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to register deceleration at the a trend that has already been and which is in line with assessments present in inflation reports and previous copom in the last twelve months through august the trade surplus reached billion below august exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and according to same comparison as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust expansion of domestic notwithstanding the elevated price levels of several commodities included in the brazilian export the decrease in trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through august equivalent to of foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of regarding the external the global economy still shows divergent with more evident signs of deceleration and still high inflation the prevailing interpretation still points to the at a moderate of economic activity in and but data released in the last few weeks indicate a more intense cooling of activity in mature mainly in the euro the united kingdom and while signs of economic activity deterioration also appeared in the despite the fiscal and monetary stimuli previously there are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in europe and parts of asia was predominantly due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices could be the secondary effects derived from the increase in raw materials and the pressures of heated demand over supply expansion which are particularly evident in emerging have sustained current inflation rates at high with significant in several over inflation a severe financial crisis in the usa to a minor in must be added to this adverse in this although the presence of inflationary pressures has been a concern for an important number of monetary their policy reactions have been and this situation tends to the us started to decelerate in the last quarter of and it still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector with spillover effects on the labor whose together with the increase in the prices of oil has reduced significantly contributing for depressing although fiscal and monetary stimuli have limited the risks of a deeper activity the dominant expectation still indicates a more consistent recovery only from even after an important reinforcement of the capital base of significant financial uncertainties about the extension and length of the us mortgage crisis developments over the local and european banking systems still as well as about the impacts over the credit availability for business and households in those systemic risk perception is still as financial problems have aggravated due to a cyclical deterioration in credit which tends to tighten financial conditions as a the risk of more intense economic in this us government intervention in large mortgage companies can be seen as a necessary although probably insufficient to overcome such most common opinion among analysts indicates that activity in europe and japan should decelerate throughout the second half of in developed prospects for the adoption of tightening policies seem on the other although showing some moderation at the emerging countries growth remains strong up to was apparently little affected by the mortgage crisis in the partially counterbalancing the activity deceleration in mature in due to the pressure over the availability of production the inflation elevation pointed to the maintenance of monetary tightening policies in several emerging the prospects for the monetary policy in emerging countries became even more complex in the last when several not only from commodityexporting significantly depreciated in relation to the in the midst of an increase of volatility and risk aversion indicators in international financial policies aiming at the reduction of external vulnerability of brazilian economy have been contributing to though not the effects of the external environment on local economic which has been driven essentially by domestic oil prices remain highly but reduced considerably since the last copom future markets and the consensus among analysts suggest that oil prices could stabilize around current uncertainty concerning these evaluations is remarkably as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the reaction to stimuli derived from previous changes on relative besides geopolitical issues that affect oil despite the great uncertainty regarding oil prices the main scenario adopted by the which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in remains it bears highlighting no matter the behavior of domestic gasoline international oil prices at historically high levels affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as by the deterioration they may cause on economic inflation the prices of other commodities also showed important reductions since the last copom finally reacting to the greater pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and to the continuity of the global financial but except for industrial inputs like nickel and they continued to increase on a twelvemonth trailing of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices were maintained at for the projections for electricity prices adjustments and fixed telephone prices were maintained unchanged at and for the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual was maintained at this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total august the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic on the benchmark based on the swap rates estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and increased by the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the july copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca variation decreased to down from ahead inflation expectations also to down from considering the medians of expected monthly inflation expectations for remained at considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the july copom but remained above the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also declined compared to the figure considered at the previous copom but remained above the central target for the regarding projections based on both scenarios decreased compared to the figures available at the july they remained above the central target for that policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite and it is at least partially responsible for the inflationary acceleration observed since the end of despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment even in the context of a deceleration of global growth this year and higher volatility observed in global markets since the committee based on information available at the moment of its that the balance of payments should not represent an imminent risk to the inflationary in general the influence of the external on the future trajectory of brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory effects and surrounded by significant on the one the prospects of more pronounced deceleration of global activity in the upcoming which are apparently point to an accommodation of both commodities prices and external and can also influence local financial on the other the cooling trend has caused an increase in risk impacting the demand for brazilian and depreciating their in this the additional reduction of net exports can with similar effects over the behavior in the prices of certain brazilian the recent trajectory of price indices still evidences the existence of mismatches between the supply and demand and of significant inflationary in several even though the intensity is now probably lower than in the middle of last in light of the deterioration of inflation prospects occurred in the last in a more uncertain the committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario is still the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to the worsening of the copom thinks that the maintenance of monetary stability is an essential condition for the relative prices system to continue efficiently signaling the necessary adjustments on current consumption and production patterns of the the copom considers that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory continues to be as the heating of domestic demand and market of as well as the possibility of emergence of supply restrictions in some may increase the of wholesale prices to consumer price the committee evaluates that the prospects for this as well as for the propagation of initially localized pressures to consumer depend in a critical manner on inflation which remain in levels incompatible with the inflation target path and continue to be carefully it is worth highlighting that although the external sector exerts some discipline on tradable goods imports prices have hiked in a strong heated domestic demand may trigger more intense inflationary pressures in the sector in services for in this the copom will act aiming to ensure that inflation control gains achieved in recent years become in this the committee will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as of inflation expectations within the forecast and will be prepared to promptly adjust the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario in which price adjustments become persistent or the maintenance of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk the copom thinks that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the even in light of global inflationary that inflation in brazil will evolve according to the targets path in for this higher probability to continue to it is necessary that inflation particularly the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit despite the more moderate pace due to an increase in funding and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the factors that will sustain these considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated domestic the dissemination of pressures stemming from adjustments in relative also over the labor and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive it bears noticing that the accommodation of commodities whose more consistent evidence appeared in the could contribute to avoid that inflationary pressures intensify even the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by income and credit continues to present significant risks to the inflationary in this the consistent and prompt reduction of the mismatch between the expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand continues to be vital to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to higher risk shorter planning horizons as a to the reduction of potential economic besides having regressive effects on income in the current there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary the strategy aims to bring inflation rates back to the midpoint established by in other in this strategy will have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the economy heating signals and the behavior of inflation the risks for the materialization of a benign inflationary in which ipca would resume the evolution in line with the targets are in the deterioration of the scenario is still present in the inflation projections considered by the the copom also considers that the persistence of significant mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand continues to represent risk for the inflationary under these monetary policy should continue to act through the adjustment of the basic interest while the balance of risks to the inflationary dynamics this adjustment on the one to reduce such mismatch on the other to avoid that inflationary pressures initially localized over price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation some members of the committee believe since the last several signs of strong deterioration in activity in developed economies have been resulting in improvement of global inflation partially due to the fall in commodities such scenario would have potential contractionary also through financial deleverage consequences over credit which would add up to the lagged effects of monetary policy over the economic with implications for the projected inflation those copom members understood to be more at this early to raise the basic interest rate by most committee currently understand that in spite of the deterioration on the global economic growth the risks to the materialization of a benign inflation scenario in the country have not presented enough improvement in those members understand that up to now there is not enough evidence of reduction of mismatch between the demand and supply expansion as perceived by the intense use of productive and that the expectations anchorage to the target path still needed to be in such those committee members understood to be more appropriate to raise the basic rate by in such evaluating the macroeconomic the copom decided to raise the selic rate to with no aimed to promptly promote convergence of inflation to the target five votes were for the monetary policy while three votes were in favor of elevating the selic rate by under the the copom guides its decisions according to the projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prices as well as the balance of risks associated to their domestic demand has continued to expand strongly and supports the economic activity including sectors less exposed to external when the effects of stimuli such as income are still acting over the brazilian on its the external sector contribution to a favorable inflationary in light of the strong rhythm of domestic demand of global inflationary as well as depreciation in the prices of brazilian have become less at a moment when the effects of investment over the productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that the uncertainty detected in horizons disseminate to if the risk profile changes in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario considered at the present the committee will promptly adjust the monetary policy stance to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on october for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september of data analyzed by the copom inflation ipca increased in decelerating relative to july food and beverages which increased in the year through reverted its upward trend and decreased in market prices increased in the compared to in with price elevations of for tradable and of for regulated prices increased in the diffusion index reached in up from in in the opposite direction of the deceleration index ipca has showed a increase over the last twelve down from in with increase on market prices and on regulated core inflation indices were relatively stable in except for the core excluding household food and regulated which increased up from in totaling in the last twelve the nonsmoothed trimmed means core reached in august in and in the last twelve the smoothed trimmed mean core reached in the same as reaching in the last twelve activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly survey expanded retail which include construction material and vehicles and parts and increased in nine out of the ten segments surveyed by the ibge emphasizing the increases of fuel and lubricants and vehicles and clothing and shoes the sales of other personal and domestic outlays decreased in the comparing to sales grew in june and in the first half of considering expanded retail under both there was generalized growth in all with highlight for those more influenced by credit supply such computing and communication material and parts and and furniture and home according to são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the database consultations for credit sales and those consultations to the usecheque system decreased and in in the year through these indicators increased and compared to the same period of regarding investment domestic production of capital goods and of construction typical inputs grew and in seasonally these indicators grew and in the year through production of construction typical inputs grew reflecting the strength in the in the same the production of capital goods grew also reflecting investments in particular those related to the modernization and expansion of production capacity of the transportation and electrical energy capital goods imports decreased in july relative to when the same indicator grew relative to according to the quantum indices from fundação centro de estudos do comércio exterior seasonally adjusted by the those variations mainly reflected the normalization of imports procedures after interruption of the services during part of the second quarter of the the july indicator was stable compared to the first half of but presented a growth in the year through the imports quantum index grew up from in the year through confirming the contribution of capital goods imports in the current cycle of investments in the brazilian credit loans granted by the development bank directed to and investments reached billion in the year through a growth over the same period of in the last twelve months through disbursements totaled a expansion relative to the same period of with highlights to the increase in infrastructure seasonally adjusted cni indicators showed a expansion in industrial real revenues in and a decrease in hours worked in industrial in the year through compared to the same period of industrial real revenues grew and hours worked in industrial production increased installed capacity utilization reached in above the june considering seasonally adjusted reaching a new record high for the observed data reached above the july according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in july seasonally seventeen out of the activities surveyed recorded production increase in by use it bears noticing the increases in the production of both capital goods and intermediate goods the production of durable consumer goods

previous environment in the international the concerns regarding inflation and global demand deceleration are the smaller growth of industrialized despite the growth of the economy in the second boosted by positive contribution of net exports and by the effects of the fiscal stimulus to the signals that the european economies are closer to a recessive process are more emerging economies maintain robust specially the asian although they record activity level compared to the high expansion rates recorded in it cannot be discarded greater economic activity cooling in these in case the global economic deceleration is more intense and regarding the recent fall of commodities including oil can provoke the accommodation of prices at a lower level in the middle available data confirm that the annual inflation levels remain high and the risks to inflation are greater in the short in face of the possibility of of this trend to wages and despite the strong deterioration of the british the bank of england maintained the interest rate at in the last monetary policy committee due to the inflationary regarding the european central the interest rate was also maintained at the international financial market turmoil although with less the strong commitment of important central banks to provide the necessary liquidity to the good run of the interbank as well as the prospect that significant part of the losses has been already registered by the financial have been fundamental for the recent performance of financial some recovery signals have been specially in the stock and credit default swaps although there are still traces of localized mainly in the interbank whose spreads related to the basic interest rates still remain at high trade and international reserves

daily a increase international reserves totaled billion in with increases of billion in the month and billion relative to the end of market and open market operations in the period between the july and the september copom the yield curve shifted upwards in short terms and shifted downwards in longer driven by the decision of the copom to increase the selic target rate by the deceleration observed in several current inflation indices and the fall in the prices of commodities also contributed to decrease the longer terms yield since the beginning of the decrease movement of longer terms yield curve was partially reverted by the worsening of the external the dollar appreciation and the increase of risk aversion as a result of the fear of global economy between july and september and rates increased by bps and and rates fell by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation increased to on september up from

economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the recovery in major although uneven across along with a moderation in financial assets is resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging there is significant uncertainty regarding the evolution of this scenario due to a possible decline in government stimuli and to the evolution of the pandemic turning to the brazilian recent indicators suggest a partial recovery in economic this is similar to the pattern of other where sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain the transfers and other government programs have allowed the brazilian economy to recover faster than other emerging uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than especially for the period starting at the end of this concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency various measures of underlying inflation remain below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and consumer inflation should rise in the short term due to a temporary food price increase and a partial normalization of some service in a context of a recovery in activity and administered prices should change moderately reflecting a decline in health plan rates in september and an expected drop in gasoline prices by the inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and constant exchange rate at stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at rises to in and in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and constant exchange rate at yields inflation projections around for for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation especially when this slack is concentrated in the service this risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary on the other fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal path for a long time or frustrations regarding the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a decline in aggregate introducing an asymmetry to the balance of this set of factors could potentially result in a path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the recovery in major although concentrated in the goods along with a moderation in financial assets is resulting in a relatively favorable environment for emerging the committee that there is significant uncertainty about the evolution of this benign a possible sudden and unorganized reduction in government stimuli may delay the recovery of consumption and the evolution of the pandemic may act as a limit to the full recovery of the service the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they evaluated that recent data suggest a partial recovery of economic government transfer programs have allowed for a relatively strong rebound in durable goods consumption and several service sector especially those more directly affected by social distancing remain significantly looking the poor predictability associated with the evolution of the pandemic and the necessary decline in emergency aid by the end of increase uncertainty about the speed of the economic the committee considered that this unpredictability and the risks associated with the evolution of the pandemic may imply a domestic scenario characterized by an even more gradual recovery of the the copom members debated on the level of economic as with the committee believes that the pandemic should continue to have heterogeneous effects on the economic given the nature of the the service sector should continue to have a larger economic slack than other the committee concluded that the nature of the crisis probably implies that the disinflationary pressures from reduced demand may last longer than in previous the committee then resumed the discussion of a potential effective lower limit for the brazilian policy interest rate and its connection with prudential and financial stability for the majority of the members of the this limit would be significantly higher among emerging economies than among developed countries due to the existence of a risk this premium is dynamic and tends to be larger in given the relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal in this we would already be close to the level from which further interest rate reductions could be accompanied by asset price the copom also discussed the relative importance of the main components of credit and operating costs of the financial considering the long history of the brazilian economy operating with the reference interest rate at a very high the unprecedented low interest rates may compromise the performance of some markets and economic with potential impact on financial based on results from stress test the committee concluded that the financial system is resilient to the credit risk arising from the current in analyzing the financial system in a broad way considering its various products and financial services the committee reflected that an unprecedented low interest rate environment may increase asset prices without the necessary time to transition to a new it may affect the proper functioning and dynamics of the financial system and the capital the committee concluded that possible new interest rates reductions would demand caution and additional to this if further interest rate cuts would require greater clarity about prospective inflation and activity and could be spaced over in order to raise the degree of monetary stimulus provided by the traditional but maintaining the necessary caution for prudential since its the copom has adopted forward guidance as an additional monetary policy to adapt the forward guidance to the dynamic limits imposed by prudential the committee considered that it should have an asymmetric policy in if the necessary conditions were the copom would not raise the interest rate but could reduce to maximize its the committee decided that this forward guidance should be conditional on inflation as well as on the inflation projections of its baseline for the relevant monetary policy which currently includes to a lesser this information on inflation would be considered altogether when they were sufficiently close to the inflation target for the corresponding they would indicate the end of the given the difficulties inherent in using forward guidance in emerging in addition to expectations and projections of inflation in the relevant the committee also deemed necessary to condition its interest rate policy intention on two other it is conditional on the maintenance of the fiscal since its rupture would imply significant changes to the structural interest rate of the it is conditional on the anchoring of inflation given that an unanchoring would indicate that the costs derived from the monetary stimulus would be outweighing its the copom judged that the conditions for the maintenance of the forward guidance continue to be the committee considers that inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline are significantly below the inflation target for the relevant monetary policy the current fiscal regime has not been and inflation expectations remain well monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes to a lesser the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary but it recognizes due to prudential and financial stability the remaining space for monetary policy if it should be possible future adjustments to the current degree of monetary stimulus would occur with additional gradualism and would depend on the perception of the fiscal as well as on new information that changes the current assessment about prospective to provide the monetary stimulus deemed adequate to meet the inflation but maintaining the necessary caution for prudential the copom considered appropriate to continue to adopt forward guidance as an additional monetary policy despite the asymmetry on its balance of the copom does not intend to reduce the monetary stimulus unless inflation as well as its baseline scenario inflation are sufficiently close to the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary which currently includes to a lesser this intention is conditional on the maintenance of the current fiscal regime and on the anchoring of inflation the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro

prices of in june on its the prices of the food and beverages group increased in the same period in june and the prices of services rose until june in available information suggest some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in may to in as a on a trailing average core inflation

recorded in june the general price index after decreasing in decreased in reaching on a trailing basis in june the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in june with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and of in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through june in june the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in june partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics decreased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in april changed seasonally the

assessment carried out by the ibge in june indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the the gross domestic product increased in the first quarter of after increasing in the previous according to data seasonally adjusted by the it expanded in the first quarter to in the fourth focusing on the aggregate demand household consumption decreased in the first quarter of

adjusted released by the according to the observed industrial production decreased in accumulating a decrease of in the first five months of the negative results were observed in three out of the four main economic categories and in out of the surveyed according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased between april and may according to the seasonally adjusted the pmi of the industrial on its indicates retraction in the brazilian production in among the use and seasonally capital goods durable consumer goods and intermediate goods reported declines in may only the and goods sector posted a positive rate regarding durable consumer goods and capital goods reported declines of and the intermediate goods sector also posted a negative it was less intense than the broad industrial sector figure the and goods was the only sector reporting a positive recording growth in ibge releasead the monthly employment survey may results covering only instead of the usual six metropolitan due to the data referring to salvador and porto alegre are yet to be the unemployment rate in may remained stable in the four metropolitan areas whose results were the unemployment rate declined in rio de janeiro and in são in recife and belo figures were data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were created in the lowest net generation for the month since in the available data indicate narrow idleness margin in the labor although there are some signs of accomodation at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume increased in compared to may on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction increased in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the broad retail sales growth rate stood at with expansion in eight out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the fell in both in the subindex related to the current as well as in the one related to the following the average index for the quarter stood at the lowest for the historical series started in march the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in according to the seasonally adjusted the nuci in june reached among the use categories of the ones showing the highest according to the seasonally adjusted are construction material and intermediate goods followed by durable consumer goods consumer goods and capital goods on its the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through the trailing trade balance result reached billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with decline of and increase of compared to the twelve months through june on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the on the other foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging with some growth moderation in the latter specifically about despite recent high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary the federal reserve has continued the process of reduction of the assets purchase program in accommodative stances prevail in the advanced in the emerging less accommodative monetary policy stances inflation remains at moderate or low levels in the advanced in the emerging it stands at higher the price of the brent oil barrel has remained at a level near since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the fact that supply growth dependends on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have fallen and those relative to metals have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through june of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in the same value considered in the may copom this projection considers gasoline and bottled gas price changes until as well as assumptions of a reduction in fixed telephone tariffs and the increase of in electricity the items for which there are more available information were projected for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for comparing to the considered in the may copom for the projected regulated price change is the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis point and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus both for and according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law and in the budget guidelines law project is considered as the fiscal in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca remained for the median of the inflation projections increased to from the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the may and remains above the inflation for according to both the inflation forecast increased relative to the value considered in the may copom and it stands above the midpoint inflation policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the despite recently released data have been less positive than the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have there are improvements in advanced with recovery of activity in some countries and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the space to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee also highlights despite recently observed localized the prospects indicate moderation in the dynamics of prices in the international as well as in the there are evidences of tension and the copom evaluates that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this compared to and in the medium important changes must take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the copom notes that the expansion rates of domestic absorption have been higher than the gdp but evidences suggest in this the consumption tends to grow at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent and the investments tend to gain regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates in the long more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have and that the services sector tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and their resulting gains depends on the strengthening of and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables and the arising of the conditions so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation on the one would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also bears emphasizing that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit important to highlight the fact after years of strong expansion cooled with the introduction of macroprudential measures at the end of the credit market oriented to consumption underwent a so over the recent quarters it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by and on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the adjustment for the minimum wage this year is not as significant as in the previous and considering the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor productivity over the recent the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for the inflation to still show this development is underpinned by two important relative prices adjustments processes now underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices in relation to market the committee recognizes that these adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts on inflation and reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from by the in order to fight these and other inflationary in the last twelve the monetary conditions were but the committee evaluates that the effects of the selic rates hikes on inflation in yet to it is plausible to claim in the presence of relatively low levels of the effects of monetary policy actions on inflation tend to be assessing the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the copom unanimously at this to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively robust in the in the relevant horizon for monetary on the one household consumption tends to record a moderate expansion due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial concession of public broadening of oil exploration among other tend to support the expansion of these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom evaluates that ongoing inflationary pressures present at the economy as those stemming from the processes of prices realignments previously mentioned and from wage gains incompatible with productivity gains tend to cool down even exhaust throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary in shorter the shift of the output gap to the disinflationary side should be the committee anticipates a scenario that includes resistant inflation in the next but considering the maintenance of the monetary condition that the strategy that does not include the reduction of the monetary policy instrument tends to enter a trajectory of convergence to the target in the final quarters of the projection in this the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on september for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june after recording in december monthly inflation measured by ipca reached in january as a trailing inflation reached above inflation registered in the twelve months through january the inflation increase in this period the behavior of market which increased and contributed of the total in the increase in regulated prices in the last twelve months through january was below the one recorded for the twelve months ended in january contributing only for the headline regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached and the goods increased in the last twelve months through january services price inflation continues at high levels in the period through january it reached in the set of available information suggests that prices acceleration observed in process lead by market may show some in part because services inflation remains at high the food prices trajectory continues to perform relevant role in recent acceleration of headline in the last three the ipca recorded up from observed in the last three months through october and in the three months ended in july in the same prices of food and beverages changed and in the last twelve household food price inflation changed from in july to in and reached in january at the same ipca inflation stood at and the recent elevation in food prices in supply domestic and heightened by the high liquidity environment in international financial markets and by global demand in line with the evolution of headline each one of the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased in january this the smoothed trimmed means core inflation moved from in december to in january in the same the double weight core inflation increased from to while the core inflation by exclusion increased from to in the last twelve months through january the three core inflation measures reached and the ipca diffusion which had reached in increased to in evidencing higher of prices acceleration the general price index inflation recorded in january value above the one registered in december in the last twelve inflation reached above the level recorded in the last twelve months through january inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in the twelve months through january according to the same comparison reflecting the increase of in the industrial ipa and in the agricultural inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through january above the recorded until january according to the same comparison the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased above the recorded in the previous as emphasized in previous copom meeting the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for products taxes it constitutes an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the performed positively in every month in the second half of but showed relative stability in december the index showed growth in december comparing to the the it increased the services confidence index from reduced in january and compared to the average industrial activity has not shown consistent signs of entering a new expansion cycle according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased by in after a retreat in and in january output is still below the record high observed in march on the other the moving average growth rate reached in the period between october and january the same rate observed in the last quarter of output increased in in the last twelve output increased in down from in continuing the process of growth the diffusion which measures the percentage of products that registered output increase reached in compared to in compared to december month that recorded the lowest output during the growth pace moderation through january reached the recovery dynamics was partially supported by the growth of industrial activity financed by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the durable consumer goods production grew in while and semi durable consumer goods expanded in the same capital goods production increased while intermediate goods production reduced considering the moving average ended in durable consumer goods production increased while and semidurable consumer goods reduced under the same capital goods production increased while intermediate goods expanded by it bears that the capital goods industry activity accumulated in twelve is the highest among the use with a such behavior evidences the investment a relevant factor for economic recovery in the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed increased from in december to in january below the level registered in january after reaching in march the observed data not only significantly reduced until but reached a record low for the month since the start of the series in march the seasonally adjusted rate registered in a increase compared to measured by the number of employed workers in the metropolitan increased in december and in january data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate growth in formal employment in eleven out of the twelve last in thousand jobs were created thousand in january while in december thousand jobs were eliminated thousand reduction in december in the last twelve months through million jobs were created million according to the criterion that considers data delivered with delay by the services was the sector that most contributed for the formal employment increase in accounting for of the increase in the the services sector also was the main driver for the increase in the last twelve being responsible for of job creation in the real average earnings observed in january increased and as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand although there is evidence that the growth rate of this indicator may decrease in the upcoming according to the retail monthly survey from the expanded retail sales has been increasing since may growth was in december in november and in according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales increased for the eighth consecutive in up in november and in average sales in the quarter ended in december increased it also bears noticing that eight out of the ten sectors surveyed performed positively in with highlights for vehicles and parts and pieces and clothing and shoes in the next the retail trajectory will continue to be benefited by governmental real payroll moderate credit expansion and consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal changed from in january to in these values are close to the observed in the same period of according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reduced from in january to in two out of the four use categories retreated in the nuci in the intermediate goods industry reduced while in the consumer goods it decreased by for the construction inputs the nuci increased from in january to in according to seasonally adjusted while in the capital goods it increased from to in the same according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the the in december reached in up from in installed capacity utilization rates have shown relative at high the high occupation level reflects the recent expansion in economic whose effects have not been totally offset by the maturity of investment in this the absorption of capital goods grew in construction inputs production increased as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance result in the last twelve months increased from billion in january to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and compared to the twelve month period ended in february current account deficit accumulated in twelve months increased from billion in december to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding the need for foreign since the last copom the trend of global economy recovery has mainly in the us whose domestic demand shows some especially in household in spite of continued uncertainties regarding labor the leading indicator published by the organization for economic and development often used for inferences regarding the future behavior of global industrial production for in the fourth consecutive monthly the indicators disaggregated by country suggest acceleration in growth pace or continued growth in all except the euro area macroeconomic in are as uncertainties regarding the solvency of some peripheral economies at the same time that the expansion pace remains strong in inflation rate cores are still at moderate levels in the group euro area and in spite of extremely expansionist economic policy both in fiscal and monetary on its headline consumer inflation rates reached in the us and in the euro in the twelve months through january mainly due to the hikes in energy in the emerging there are inflationary pressures in latin asia and eastern since the last meeting there was a moderate monetary tightening in several economies among china and the bank of china announced the fifth increase in reserve since november last brent oil prices have increased since the last copom surpassing the this price acceleration is consistent with a framework of apparent strengthening in the global demand framework given that empiric evidences suggest that international oil in the last two have been determined more by global demand conditions than by the supply side as well as with political instability in some countries of the middle east in north it bears highlighting that geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten price which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it is also noteworthy the continuous increase in the prices of international agricultural and metallic commodities in this the current quarterly readjustment system for iron ore price reinforces future price increase the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers reached a new record high in january resulting in increase in twelve this movement was among other by the increase in international prices of cereals and vegetable in recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices seems to have been strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to fx markets of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline an bottled gas prices in were kept unchanged at the same considered at the january copom the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity rates in were kept at and the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual according to the benchmark was kept at unchanged relative to the january this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total january the projection for regulated prices inflation in according to the benchmark was reduced to down from considered in the january such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of without in to parameters contained in the budget guidelines law a primary surplus of is considered for the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements measures announced in since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations moved from to the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the january copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin at the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projection reduced in the benchmark but still stands above the midpoint in the market it stands around the midpoint policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic mainly price it is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation targets regime stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the fx and the inflationary risk premiums among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has increased in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy in international volatility and risk aversion have increased since the last copom partially fueled by the extraordinary levels of global although the chances of adoption of a new set of unconventional monetary actions and adverse geopolitical developments have while concerns about european sovereign and banking debts and the possible deceleration in china have remained the confidence in the sustainability of the us economy recovery has prices of relevant commodities without in the opposite of domestic assets in the prospects for external funding of brazilian economy remain the trajectory of prices indexes shows some dissemination of inflationary pressures in the main the copom evaluates although moderation of domestic demand growth is yet in uncertain prospects for economic activity are this assessment is supported by signs that point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and despite showing some and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and substantial growth of real particularly in the public the copom evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario has not developed favorably since the last in in the last quarter of and at the beginning of this inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by the dynamics of food which in part reflected domestic and external supply evidences suggest that consumer prices have already incorporated substantial part of these and have also absorbed the seasonal effects typical from the first two months of the the localized effects stemming from atypical concentration of regulated prices readjustments in the same period were also for the year as a the behavior of these items tends to be relatively the committee considers that these effects should still impact consumer prices among other through at the same it as risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth despite the signs that this mismatch tends to it highlights the narrow idleness margin of the production specially labor and analysis in such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases incompatible with productivity it is also noteworthy to mention the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory in international which has been surrounded by great the copom considers two distinct moments for inflation according to the main in this quarter and in the following inflation accumulated in twelve months tends to remain at levels similar or above the current in is explained by the high inertia that stemmed from and by the fact that the in contrast with what was observed in point to inflation rates close to the historical standard in the quarter ending in august from the fourth quarter the main scenario indicates a downward trend for the inflation accumulated in twelve moving to the target the copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation besides contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend in the public it bears highlighting that since the last committee important decisions have been taken and which support the vision in the beginning of this a fiscal consolidation process the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit for which the macro prudential actions recently adopted the committee considers although such regulatory changes target primarily the financial system they should also materialize as an element of aggregate demand constraint through the credit as well as through the reduction of incentives to the adoption of strategies such as the simple extension of contract among the available information confirm this by evidencing relevant impacts both in the prices and in the volumes negotiated in the credit it is plausible to affirm that the current regulatory compared to the previous tends to intensify the impacts of conventional monetary policy in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which an uncertainty level and identifies increasing risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation promptly converges to the midpoint since the last copom at the external stimuli factors and assets prices spillovers have pointed to lower probability of reversion in the recovery process experienced by the from another they still reveal the ambiguous influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation regarding the domestic the recently announced macro prudential actions a fast and powerful tool to contain local demand pressures and conventional monetary policy actions will still have their effects incorporated to price although uncertainties that surround the global outlook at a minor the domestic do not allow the clear identification of the degree of permanence of recent the committee evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario has not evolved in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although recent initiatives point to some constraint in public sector fiscal and credit incentives provided to the economy in the last quarters should still contribute for the activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness level of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial crisis by macro prudential and conventional monetary policy actions recently these elements and the fiscal and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets in an alternative which takes in consideration the maintenance of the foreign exchange in the relevant at levels similar to the observed in the recent and the interest rate path collected by projected inflation is above the target rate in and slightly below it in considering this alternative scenario and prospects of domestic activity as well as the current complexity of the international among other the introduction of macro prudential actions may create opportunities for the reassessment of monetary policy at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on april for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the rose in up from in january and in totaling in the year and in twelve according to

economic activity accelerated for the second consecutive quarter in the reaching quarterly annualized increase of in the fourth quarter of up from in the previous the result among other household consumption growth and imports the labor market has continued to recover in the personal available income grew in for the fourth consecutive in the euro the strong winter contributed to the deceleration of gdp growth from to while in fourth quarter gdp contracted by in the same china gdp interannual growth accelerated to from in the previous recent corporate and manufacturing activity confidence indicators showed acceleration in the economic activity at the start of the year in the the purchase management index for the global manufacturing industry activity grew for the ninth consecutive month in showing increase in its expansion the february specific for the euro reached a record high since june although most recent data suggest resumption of economic activity in the main it is important highlight that this favorable scenario depends on the crisis development in north africa and the middle commodities international prices have registered new increase since the last copom although they have presented higher volatility in the last due to the geopolitical the prices of agricultural commodities continue to be quite impacted by the deterioration of supply conditions in several by consumption mainly in emerging and by low global when compared to oil prices increased substantially on the one uncertainties related to possible supply shock due to geopolitical tensions on the other the impact over demand resulting from favorable prospects for economic in the financial despite the recent volatility the prospects for developed economies growth have favorably impacted stock market in these compared to those related to emerging in annual cpi increased in the euro uk and among reaching and compared to and in while in the us energy annual prices grew in in the increase in food prices was the main driver of the despite recent increases in inflation inflationary pressures are contained in the main developed except in the considering core inflation annual growth in january reached and in the euro area and in the among emerging in addition to food prices increases have contributed for inflationary in annual cpi reached in russia and in in the context of contained inflationary the federal reserve and the european central bank maintained their accommodative monetary policy unchanging their basic interest decision followed by the bank of in the opposite since the last copom central banks of several emerging countries have increased their respective basic interest among south russia and in the bank of china announced new increase in the reserve requirements in the second in the trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in exports reached billion and in the the trade surplus was above the registered in according to the daily average reflecting expansions of in exports and in total trade grew in the totaling billion in compared to billion in the same period of international reserves reached billion in increasing billion compared to the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic market until february market and open market operations since the last copom in the futures interest rate yield curve reduced its moving upwards short term rates and keeping tenors higher than a year relatively in the short the main drivers of the movement were the worsening of inflation expectations and the release of still high current inflation indexes and prices collected between january and february and interest rates increased and interest rate increased while and rates reduced real interest measured by the rate between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on january to on february between january and february the central bank carried out reverse exchange rate swap in which it assumed long fx position and short interest rate this operation totaled the equivalent to billion in notional in its open market the bcb carried between january and february repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between thirteen and thirty working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of tenure liquidity management the very including the tenure liquidity management averaged a daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreements of the central bank increased from billion between december and january to between january and february considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was a reduction in the daily balance of repurchase agreements totaling reducing the total stock from billion on january to billion on february the main drivers of liquidity contraction in the period were the net revenues of the central government and the issuance of net securities by the national between january and february the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and ipca inflation strongly accelerated from in december to in january and in as a inflation accumulated in the first two months of reached above the level registered in the same period of the previous the acceleration of inflation in under this criterion mirrors both the behavior of market prices and of regulated focusing on market both prices of tradable goods and goods accelerated in the first two reaching and up from and in the same period of on the other the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of decreased from in the first two months of to in the same period of preliminary data for march point to consumer inflation below that observed in january and in information available suggests deterioration of inflation dynamics at the the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed divergent behavior between december and the core inflation by exclusion increased from in to in january and in smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation measures accelerated in january and retreated in february and in to and in and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and double weight trimmed means core note that all core measures continued to according to trailing compared to local record lows observed in october and two of them are above the inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index increased from in december to in february to in february the general price index inflation increased in january and in up from in in the year through the inflation reached in the first two months of under this comparison the acceleration of the reflected the behavior of its three the wholesale price index increased from in the first two months of to in the same period of on its the consumer price increased in the same period in still according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in the first two months of regarding the the inflation under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of industrial while the agricultural ipa increased in the first two months of the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached in the first two months of as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation the ibge and geography brazilian released information about gdp and a review of previous the data showed expansion in which increased in the fourth and a increase according to seasonally adjusted on the aggregate demand household consumption and public administration consumption and gross fixed capital formation increased and imports grew according to the same comparison whereas exports declined the positive contribution of domestic absorption to the gdp growth totaled overweighting the negative impact exerted by the external on the aggregate supply still according to the same comparison the services sector presented the best growing by followed by industry and which decreased relative to the same period of the gdp deflator under market on a changed from at the end of to in the fourth quarter of on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output remained stable in after increasing in december and in still considering the seasonally adjusted according to the after the retreat observed in industrial output increased by in on a industrial output increased by in down from in the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output and its suggests that production experiences expansion at a pace which continues to be influenced by the by business and as well as by the easing of domestic financial supported not only by traditional sources of but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in january it bears highlighting the expansions in intermediate goods production and in durable consumer goods strongly influenced by the automotive which increased the and consumer goods production increased capital goods recording a accommodated in december and after rising in the recovery in industrial production despite initially led by the production of durable has become more widespread than reflecting tax exemption currently in reversion as well as also the easing in financial conditions and income the future behavior of industrial which should not be uniform over will depend on these as well as on the evolution of consumer and businessmen which should continue to be sources of to which will be added the recovery of external labor market has behaved more with benign aspects prevailing over signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey changed from in november to in increasing to in january in january according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached in down from in the previous average real earnings increased in after falling by in the previous on its increased by in december and by in as a real payroll expanded in december and in january continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that the formal employment has continued to despite the seasonal job cuts in thousand jobs were created in the first two months of a record high for the series in this the manufacturing industry showed positive balance of thousand jobs in the same together with the services and civil also represented the highest balance registered for the series for this the most dynamic sector continues to be civil recording a increase compared to the first two months of according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after increasing by in on a the indicator increased in the threemonth moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after remaining stable in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of and and material and expanded retail sales data have been evidencing mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable in response to temporary sector incentives granted by the to the improvement in the access to credit supply and to income for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit and by the evolution of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in above the level registered in the same month of according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci changed from to between december and considering the monthly series with seasonal the nuci calculated by fgv reached in february in the previous above the average observed in the last five the nuci in the consumer construction material and capital goods industries in february in the same and above the respective averages for the historical the nuci in the intermediate goods industry stood above the same historical the reduction of the idle capacity has been led by the expansion in economic not totally offset by the maturity of investment on its data regarding the absorption of capital goods showed recovery compared to the same periods of and decline at the margin in january after four consecutive months of accumulating a the absorption of capital goods decreased in according to seasonally adjusted a increase in but an decrease in the last twelve on its the production of construction inputs remained stable at the margin in after increasing by in according to observed it recorded a increase in january in accumulating a fall in the last twelve in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have been increasing in the last showing reduction in any remaining idle margin of the despite the recovery of as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance retreated at the reaching a billion surplus in and decreasing to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of trade the increase in remittances of profits and dividends has contributed to elevate the trailing current account which reached billion in january up from billion in december equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in equivalent to of the period since the last copom after some initial was marked by the continuity of the normalization process in international financial in an environment with limited perception of systemic these developments can be attributed to some reduction in the concerns regarding fiscal deterioration in some mature notably in despite the beginning of the reversal of the strong liquidity expansion occurred in notwithstanding the remaining high degree of under these there was some recovery in the demand for risky as evidenced by the behavior of international financial in face of fiscal the focus in the currency market was the depreciation of euro against other regarding the global macroeconomic the current predominant view points to the recovery in and some acceleration in in a process where the europe and japan would recover some but which would continue to be led by emerging the us economy recorded robust growth in the last quarter of sustained by the recovery of and the labor market performance showed some the economic activity in on its shows signs of consistent led by especially to in the euro where household consumption remains the recovery in the fourth quarter of was quite in uncertainty regarding the sustainability of consumption expansion in mature economies still in a scenario of withdrawal of economic policy stimuli and modest prospects for credit but recovery seems to be in many emerging economic activity seems to have embarked on a consistent path of in some evidence of heat in the markets of production factors and inflation record lows in mature economies and major emerging economies have been in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy in several monetary policy began a phase of whereas those economies that were less impacted by the international crisis and recover more quickly and intensely tend to adopt more restrictive monetary policy oil spot prices have increased since the last copom future markets have increased as uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in a context of global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can eventually affect domestic prices through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact on the evolution of food such as soybeans and have presented stability since the last copom the same behavior was recorded for industrial commodities except for which have notably of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity prices for were kept unchanged at and the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was kept unchanged at this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total february the projection for regulated prices inflation for increased from to on the benchmark such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be adjusted by the possibility of reduction by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refer to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to the level of of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations increased from to the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered in the january copom and is significantly above the midpoint of the target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also standing significantly above the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection increased relative to the figure considered in the january copom and is above the inflation midpoint in the same the projection under the market scenario increased and stands around the midpoint monetary policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in international risk aversion has shown cooling since the last copom in a context of abundant under this both brazilian asset which had also been favoring the easing of domestic financial as well as the prices of some selected showed it bears emphasizing that the prospects for foreign funding of brazilian economy remain on the other the trajectory of price indices evidences the resumption of external inflationary the benign impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path could come to an in light of the persistence of uncertainty regarding the behavior of asset and commodities prices in the context of gradual normalization of international financial the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom believes with the confirmation of the incipient evidences of intensification of domestic demand pressures over the market of the probability that initially localized inflationary episodes pose risks to the inflation trajectory in this the risk of of wholesale price upward pressures to consumer prices increases as the committee judges that the materialization of this as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer continues to depend critically on the economic expectations for inflation and on the idleness degree of the among other these and other variables are part of the information that is taken into account in the generation of the inflation forecasts of the which constitute a central element in the assessment on the prospective inflation it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand tends to exert some pressure over the prices of such as in the upcoming in any the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom considers important to once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its which suffered some deterioration in recent instead of current inflation the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain as evidenced by data on manufacturing capacity utilization and the labor as well as by signs of continued expansion of credit both for individuals and it should be noted that consumers and businessmen confidence is at historically high under these the pace of activity depends significantly upon the evolution of real the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and the increments of governmental transfers that will occur in the upcoming the dynamism of activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial among other by the policies of official in the most recent data on domestic economic activity reinforce the assessment mentioned in previous copom meeting minutes that the contractionist influence of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which monetary policy could become but would not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decision will have more impacts from the middle of the copom believes that the main risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario regarding the external from a possible rise in commodity prices regarding the domestic from the cumulative and lagged effects of the financial conditions easing and the fiscal and credit impulse over the evolution of domestic taking into account the dynamics of consumption and in the context of the rapid reduction in the idleness margin in the use of production the balance of these influences on the future trajectory of inflation will be crucial for the assessment of the different monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk for both private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that the convergence of inflation towards the targets path observed in continues to be registered in and this implies that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the committee considers that the accommodation of driven by the tightening of financial conditions and the deterioration of the as well as by the contraction of the global was it is reasonable to affirm that the economy is already in an expansion while there is still uncertainty to be resolved over time about the pace of this under this which is supported by the data available so monetary policy must ensure inflationary pressures remain in the committee evaluates given the signs of strength in domestic resulting in the reduction in the idleness margin of the production as evidenced by indicators of manufacturing capacity utilization and labor and by the recent behavior of inflation the risks to the achievement of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation have under this monetary policy should remain especially vigilant in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer in light of these there was consensus among committee members about the need to implement an adjustment in the basic interest in order to contain the gap between the pace of domestic demand and productive as well as to strengthen the anchoring of inflation under these the majority of the committee in light of information available at the considering the fact that the process of withdrawal of stimuli introduced during the crisis has already evaluated that it is more prudent to await the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until the next so that to start the adjustment of the basic interest on the other the other committee who understood that inflation projections and the balance of risks would support the beginning of the adjustment already at this voted for an immediate increase in the basic interest under this assessing the macroeconomic outlook and the inflation the copom decided to maintain the selic rate at without five votes were for the monetary policy and three votes were for increase in the selic the committee will carefully monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next in order to define the next steps in its monetary policy under the the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a brief domestic demand largely thanks to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit on its important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and should contribute for the consolidation of activity resumption and for the reduction of any residual idleness margin of productive the effects of these stimuli will be an important part of the context in which future decisions on monetary which must ensure the maintenance of inflation convergence to the targets path in and will be in it bears noticing that there was also consensus among the committee members about the need to adapt the pace of adjustment of the basic interest rate to the developments in the prospective inflation as well as to the corresponding balance of in order to limit the impacts caused by the behavior of current inflation over the underlying prices at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on april for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in up from in the largest increase since may considering the last twelve the index increased up from in the annual adjustment of school fees with percentage constituting the greatest impact on the ipca in food and and which have higher weights in the also recorded monthly despite their deceleration when compared to changes observed in the increase in market prices rose from in january to in mainly driven by the higher change recorded by up from in the previous while the prices of tradable goods increased down from in regulated prices increased down from in mainly reflecting the lower impact of public transportation in the last twelve months through market prices rose and regulated prices increased against and in the diffusion index stood at in down from the previous the which excludes all fuel items and ten items of household accelerated in the from to in twelve it slightly reaching in down from in the smoothed core measure increased in down from in increasing by in twelve compared to in the previous the double weight core increased by in the down from in increasing in twelve down from in the increased by in after rising in with increase in wholesale prices and deceleration in consumer price inflation and construction prices the expanded by and in the year and twelve the increased in the up from in an increase both in agricultural and in industrial in the the increased and in twelve the rose in down from in increasing by in the year and in twelve with deceleration in five of seven groups that compose the increased down from in the previous with highlights to the smallest change in the prices of the labor which increased down from in in the year and twelve the index expanded by and activity gdp grew in down from in according to seasonally adjusted data from the quarterly national accounts of the the result reflected respective expansions of and in the performance of industry and services while agricultural production remained stable in the on the demand gdp growth was led by with a increased in the fixed capital gross according to the same comparison household and government grew and confirming the importance of the contribution of domestic demand for greater dynamism of economic activity in the despite the recovery since the second quarter of gdp fell by in the expanded retail sales increased in after rising in december and falling in according to seasonally adjusted data by the monthly survey the average sales for the quarter ended in january rose compared to the quarter ended in expanded retail sales grew increasing by in the last twelve months through all ten sectors surveyed reported increases with highlights for furniture and and equipment and office all commerce segments with highlights to the increases in the sales of equipment and office and furniture and in the last twelve there were increases in eight of the ten sectors with emphasis on the growth in pharmaceutical and medical articles and vehicles and parts and both recording among the segments that presented negative according to the same comparison it bears noticing construction and clothing and data from the são paulo trade association covering the state showed increases of in the number of consultations to the central credit protection service and to the usecheque in according to the seasonally adjusted in the year through these indicators increased and relative to the same period last automobile sales by including light commercial trucks and rose in february according to fenabrave federation of automotive vehicles adjusted by the the increase in the month reflects mainly the performance of car followed by light commercial while buses and trucks sales decreased and it should be noticed that the push in car sales in february also reflected the proximity to the closing date for the sale of vehicles with discounted tax over industrialized products which will take place in total sales increased with emphasis on the growth of trucks and light commercial vehicles capital goods imports decreased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the january indicator increased reaching an decline in the last twelve months through compared to the same period last capital goods production decreased in and expanded according to seasonally adjusted it bears highlighting the fall in production of capital goods for for agricultural and for industrial compared to the same period of it bears noticing the production of capital goods for which increased the production of construction inputs remained stable and increased industrial production increased in when it had registered seasonally according to monthly industrial survey physical production industrial ouput grew by accumulating a reduction in the last twelve over the same previous it bears highlighting in january the expansion in the production of durable consumer and intermediate the production of semi and consumer goods increased all use categories with emphasis on the increase of in durable consumer goods and in intermediate goods in a trailing production retreated in the four categories of especially in capital falling by followed by intermediate with retreated real earnings in the manufacturing industry declined in january while in december it expanded by according to data released by the seasonally despite the decline at the employment and hours worked rose by and in the same these indicators increased and according to the nuci reached in percentage points higher than the level observed in the same month of considering the seasonally adjusted the nuci was below the level recorded in but expanded by in the quarter ended in in fourteen out of the nineteen segments of the manufacturing the nuci presented positive performance according to vehicles production reached thousand units in increasing by according to seasonally adjusted vehicles production increased in in the year and twelve months through the production of vehicles increased and domestic sales of vehicles decreased in while in the year and twelve months through it increased and compared to the same periods in exports increased and in the but decreased in the last twelve the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in february estimated the production of million tons in up from million tons in the new estimate represents an increase relative to with projected expansions of and for the production of soybeans and for products directly related to the basic such as beans and the survey projected changes of and and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index decreased in when it reached a record high for the this result reflected the falls of in the expectations index in the current economic conditions index the icc increased according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the fgv the icc decreased in seasonally in the the current situation index and the expectations index decreased and the icc increased resulting from the increases of in the isa and of in the the industry confidence index from fgv reached points in the highest level recorded since december standing above the level observed in according to seasonally adjusted data and higher than the level observed in february by monthly increases were recorded for the current situation index and for the seasonally expansions of and were recorded for the same according to the cni the industrial businessmen confidence cooled in as evidenced by the industrial business confidence index which fell to down from points registered in despite the related to seasonal the index remains percentage points above the historical market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in a record high for the series for this accumulating thousand hires in the last twelve considering seasonally adjusted employment level expanded the manufacturing industry outperformed in the with the opening of thousand at the employment in the sector grew considering seasonally adjusted and the service sector created thousand jobs in the with increases of and in the employment and the construction sector was responsible for the supply of thousand jobs during the representing growth in the level of employment of and according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in increasing and declining the increase in unemployment in the month resulted from the fall of thousand higher than the reduction of thousand people in the economically active population in seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate fell by in the month and reached according to the average real earnings usually earned by workers increased after falling in and decreased the first decline recorded according to this basis comparison basis since july payroll grew and and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in equivalent to of with increases of in the month and of in the last twelve credit operations increased in the month and in the last twelve among the credit operations to individuals increased in the month and in twelve while credit operations to corporate decreased and expanded according to the same comparison earmarked credit operations increased in january and in twelve mainly influenced by housing credit and the ones granted by the which rose and in the last twelve the average interest rate on credit used as reference for interest increased again in reaching up from the previous the average annual rate on credit for individuals reached in the up from in and the average rate on corporate credit increased above the level recorded in the previous the average tenure on credit used as reference for interest increased in january for the fifth consecutive reaching up from days in the average tenure of corporate credit operations reached while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety reduced from in december to in delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate remained stable in and with declined reaching net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in compared to in january and environment the set of data released since the last copom meeting is less clear regarding the support of a steady process of economic growth resumption in despite positive results for gdp in the euro area and the united the japanese figures were revised and at the euro data showed strong decline it is noteworthy that significant improvement in domestic demand in japan results from the consumption of durable especially as a result of fiscal it also bears emphasizing the deterioration in expectations of european the contraction in the index of purchases by managers in in addition to the reduction in the number of hours worked and weekly earnings in the labor market in the in several the southeast asian emerging economies continue to gain a scenario that also prevails in commodity exporter countries in latin this recovery environment of emerging economies is supported not only by a pickup in domestic but also by the force of the chinese to which converges significant share of exports of commodities whose prices continue to after the price correction at the beginning of due to these consumer price indices in annual rises of and in philippines and all of them presenting accelerating the same behavior was observed in the euro area and the united which recorded and in this despite the exhaustion of the processes of most central bank believe that inflation expectations remain as the recovery is still particularly in mature these central banks have kept the focus on liquidity including the closure of programs to increase the liquidity created during the an increase in the basic interest among the central banks of emerging the bank of china raised again the reserve a process also undertaken by the reserve bank of while the monetary authority of malaysia surprised by increasing the interest similar to the action taken again by the reserve bank of since the last copom the major tensions in international economy have stemmed from the risks related to fiscal especially in where uncertainties regarding the ability to rollover debt has particularly in greece and but also in italy and trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached million in accumulating million in the compared to billion in the same period of in twelve the surplus reached growing in the exports totaled and growing by and on a daily average external trade reached billion in the year through growing by relative to the same period of external trade reached billion in the first two months of growing by based on the liquidity international which encompass the balance of borrowing operations in foreign reached billion in recording a million growth the cash international reserves totaled recording a million according to the same comparison the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of million in with highlights to the acquisitions of million on a cash market and open market operations in the period following the copom meeting in the slope of the yield curve with increase in rates and decrease in the rates whose maturities are over one in the component of the yield the successive upward revisions in inflation the disclosure of higher price indices and activity data and employment suggesting a consistent recovery of the contributed to this the component of the yield curve was influenced by the expectation of anticipation of the increasing cycle in the basic interest rate and by the inflow of foreign between january and march and and rates increased by and the and rates decreased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on january to on march in its open market the bcb carried out between january and march repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between and working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of tenure liquidity management the very including the tenure liquidity management averaged a daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreement of the central bank decreased from billion between december and january to billion between january and march considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was a fall in the repurchase agreements totaling with a decrease in total stock from billion on january to billion in march the main driver of liquidity contraction in the period was the net placement of securities by the national between january and march the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of ntnbs reached for securities maturing in and the set of indicators of economic activity released since the last copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the brazilian economy in the short run and gradual the recent increase in uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy had a negative impact on confidence available information suggests that the impact of this drop in confidence on economic activity has been limited so the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment the global outlook has been as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery without pressuring financial conditions in developed this has contributed to support risk appetite towards emerging in changes in economic policy in some central economies have become less inflation developments remain disinflation is widespread and includes ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary so the effects of higher uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy have been neither inflationary nor inflation expectations collected by the focus survey for and fell to around and expectations for are around and expectations for are around the path of administered prices underlying the inflation scenarios produced by the committee assumes increases of for and for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the may copom meeting and and interest rates of per annum at the end of the same under these the inflation projections for and retreated to around and risks around baseline inflation scenario the uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the brazilian economy those that pertain to fiscal and credit remains as the main risk the global despite currently still carries risks associated with the monetary policy normalization process in central with changes in economic policy in some central and with possible impacts on risk appetite for emerging the sharp disinflation in food and industrial prices might produce effects in addition to the direct on it might contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and inflation in other sectors of the the economic recovery might be more gradual and delayed than the discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic in light of available they all agreed that the process of stabilization of the economy seems to have they also judged although a gradual recovery is most the pace of recovery remains regarding the global the committee members pointed out the recent favorable evolution of the global with gradual bank of brazil of without pressures on financial conditions in developed the committee members also discussed the continuation of risks associated with the monetary policy normalization process in central economies and with the outlook for the chinese with possible impacts on risk appetite for emerging they also highlighted that the brazilian economy nowadays shows greater capacity to respond to occasional negative developments in the global due to its more robust balance of payments and to the progress in the disinflationary process and in the anchoring of all committee members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable the members of the committee analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent considering the scenario that conditions on paths of the interest rate and exchange rate extracted from the focus projections for inflation reach a trough in the third quarter of the year and increase in the last months of the year to around in part of this difference in relation to the target for can be attributed to the primary effects of the favorable food price this scenario assumes an interest trajectory that reaches at the end of and in this the inflation trajectory reaches in members of the committee assessed the impacts on inflation of the recent increase of on fuel the total impact on ipca inflation is estimated at over the months of july and but with higher concentration in part of this impact was already embedded in the conditional the members of the committee also debated the impact on july ipca inflation of the change in the flag on electricity tariffs from green to which is estimated at around all concluded that these oneoff oscillations in particular the ones related to fuel and electricity which have been more volatile do not have relevant implications for the conduct of monetary the members of the committee assessed the possible impacts of increased uncertainty related to the pace of reforms and adjustments in the economy on the prospective path of they concluded that the available information suggests limited impacts so both through inflationary and disinflationary the copom members assessed the extension of the monetary easing including its implications for the level of interest rates throughout the extension will depend on the evolution of cyclical factors of economic of the other aforementioned risk factors and of the projections and expectations of ipca inflation for and and also on the estimates for the structural interest rate of brazilian the committee judges that the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy those that pertain to fiscal and credit is important to the reduction of the structural interest these estimates naturally involve uncertainty and will continue to be reassessed by the committee over the committee members reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation with inflation forecasts a little below target for and with the high level of economic the baseline scenario prescribes continuation of the monetary easing this understanding already considers the current risks around the baseline scenario and the estimates of the extension of the the committee understands for a given estimate of its the pace of monetary easing depends on the stage of the without necessarily reflecting changes in the baseline scenario or in the balance of all members of the copom agreed despite the increased uncertainty related to the pace of implementation of reforms and adjustments in the the evolution of the economy since the may copom meeting is compatible with the reduction of the selic rate to percent the members of the committee discussed the next steps for monetary in this they assessed the convenience of signaling the possible magnitudes of monetary easing at the next the analysis regarding the convenience of signaling and the suitable magnitude of monetary easing involved considerations about the projections for inflation and economic the estimates of the extension of the cycle and its current and the risks surrounding the scenario and these including those associated with the prospects for reforms and adjustments in the bank of brazil the copom members agreed on the importance of but reaffirmed their preference for communicating conditionalities for the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality that guides their this contributes to increase transparency and improve copom the committee discussed the convenience of signaling an additional easing of the same magnitude as the one adopted at this versus a more moderate they decided to for the next copom a possible monetary easing of the same magnitude as the one adopted at the current but which will depend on the continuation of the conditions described in the baseline scenario and on the estimates of the extension of the in the magnitude of monetary easing will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation forecasts and the committee members once again emphasized that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would allow the copom to focus on preventing effects of relative price adjustments that may occur over the copom understands that it should seek to identify the primary effects of these relative price to which monetary policy should not monetary policy focus on possible effects of those which might contribute to changes in inflation projections and also in light of the recent increase in all members of the committee emphasized again that the approval and implementation of notably those of fiscal and credit and of adjustments in the brazilian are fundamental to the sustainability of to the full operation of monetary and to the reduction of its structural interest with widespread benefits for the committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms as the recent approval of the labor and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvement of the business these efforts are fundamental for stabilization and resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by one percentage to percent per without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes is compatible with the monetary easing the copom emphasizes that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend on cyclical factors and on estimates of the structural interest rate of the brazilian the committee judges that the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the economy those that pertain to fiscal and credit is important for the reduction of estimates of the structural interest the committee will continue to reassess these estimates over the copom emphasizes despite the increase in uncertainty regarding the evolution of reforms and adjustments in the the continuation of economic conditions so far has allowed the same pace of monetary easing at the current regarding the next copom maintenance of this pace will depend on the continuation of conditions described in the baseline scenario and on estimates of the extension of the monetary easing the pace of easing will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation forecasts and the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes luiz edson otávio ribeiro reinaldo le sidnei corrêa and tiago couto in the ipca rose up from in the increase was due to acceleration in both regulated price inflation especially and market price inflation particularly fuel alcohol and the rise was mainly due to seasonal and not representing a risk to convergence of inflation to the targets set by the national monetary council the ipca diffusion index remained stable at inflation is expected to decelerate in in spite of seasonal tuition fees and will likely be somewhat lower than the rate expected when the january meeting was together with headline core inflation measures also accelerated in despite not interrupting the recent downward core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated smoothed and trimmed means rose and compared to and in although january cores were higher than in january trailing figures available indicators signal that february cores might remain just as preliminary figures for march indicate some after rising to in january from in the general price index declined in february to maintaining a downward trend in terms of trailing the january increase was due to acceleration of the wholesale price component which grew in in the decline was favored by contraction to as industrial and agricultural prices in the twelve months through and stood at and while industrial and agricultural ipa registered and after rises in there are consistent signs of accommodation in wholesale price with potential positive spillover effects on consumer prices in the coming as emphasized in recent continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for future gdp grew in or in the last quarter of compared to the same quarter of in seasonally adjusted gdp grew relative to the third quarter a contraction was with regard to annual growth reached or in the fourth quarter relative to the same period of demand expansion was mainly driven by a rise in household equivalent to a seasonally adjusted growth of relative to the previous apparently an unusual inventory adjustment process continued to take place in the with regard to aggregate industrial production grew a seasonally adjusted while agriculture and services grew and as to fixed capital investment and exports grew and on the same government consumption remained while imports fell looking expansion in both employment and income higher and a more flexible monetary policy are factors that will favor economic activity in the coming economic activity will benefit from the new minimum wage as well as increases in fiscal spending in the last quarter of after performing poorly in the third manufacturing activity resumed an upward trend in the last quarter of seasonally adjusted data revised by the ibge show a growth in november to previously and in december consecutive monthly growth and a record for a expansion in the continuing the diffusion process initiated in out of manufacturing sectors expanded in leading and coincident indicators suggest modest growth in despite persistent expansion on a moving average all use categories showed positive performance in despite sharp differences among durable consumer goods production grew after falling in while capital goods production increased compared to in the previous on the other intermediate and and nondurable consumer goods performed below growing and moving averages increased for all use though at a slower pace than suggested by the seasonally adjusted in capital and durable consumer goods production grew and in the durable consumer goods production grew driven by credit while and consumer goods expanded reflecting real income capital goods production grew albeit expanding versus december construction inputs grew only but accelerated at the end of the signaling good perspectives for the expansion was of as compared to december and against the last quarter of that labor market has sustained a positive in line with gdp expansion in the last two and remains a key factor to demand the unemployment rate measured by ibge reached in compared to in december and in january the monthly increase was probably due to seasonal such as a reduction in temporary whereas the decline from january levels is attributable to improved macroeconomic which translated into a expansion in the number of employed the highest rise since june after increasing by in real earnings decreased in but stood above january partially reflecting the positive effects of lower inflation on real according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment rose in while real payrolls rose these indicators confirm the recent trend in favor of higher quality jobs in manufacturing formal employment as measured by the ministry of labor and employment maintained an upward trajectory in with more than thousand new in more than million jobs were ibge seasonally adjusted data for december showed a increase in retail sales relative to november and a increase relative to december in the retail sales expanded by this performance largely reflects expansion of sales that are more sensitive to income and but it also mirrors the favorable dynamics of moving average sales grew for the second consecutive month and reached a new record preliminary data for january and february suggest additional growth a favorable outlook for retail in is supported by positive labor market credit expansion and the monetary easing in addition to the recovery in consumer capacity utilization in manufacturing sector continued to increase in as measured by registering a seasonally adjusted expansion compared to the previous this process takes place in a period of maturing investment projects made in recent capital goods absorption rose in pushed by an increase in capital goods imports even with fixed capital investment on the performance of aggregate supply in coming quarters will be fundamental to define future inflation recent data confirm a favorable external trade performance at the start of exports reached billion and billion in january and driven primarily by the growth in manufactured exports of total exports in the twelve months through exports grew a record and the trade balance surpassed imports increased in the capital goods imports grew in january and in compared to the same months last reinforcing their increasing weight in total the current account posted a million deficit in driven mainly by unusual profits and dividend the contribution of external demand to gdp is expected to decrease in albeit still significant to economic at the start of brazilian sovereign risk reached levels below basis points for the first reflecting improved particularly robust trade together with adequate consolidated public sector primary continued accumulation of international reserves and a better pubic debt the call on brady bonds and the exemption of the withholding tax on foreign investments in local public debt securities contributed to reduce the brazil to close to basis on the other uncertainties to future monetary policy in advanced economies resulted in upward pressures on interest with potential impact over capital flows to emerging copom continues to assign a low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial markets that could affect brazilian external financing as the economy is increasingly resilience to external in international oil prices reached the highest levels since beginning of in prices declined but remained at high this need not prompt significant domestic inflationary due to the adjustment in fuel prices in the recent reduction in the share of ethanol in gasoline may drive fuel prices though they may bounce back throughout the copom maintains a scenario in which there is no change to domestic oil prices in given the international oil prices remain a key concern to future inflation because of the to domestic prices as well as the influence on market assessment of inflation trends inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available assumptions are as projections for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in remained unchanged at fixed line telephone rates are projected to go up as against considered in on the opposite household electricity projection is down from to for all regulated and considering their composition change discussed in the december inflation the copom maintained the adjustment projection for these according to the weights released by the ibge in represent of the total the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on the endogenous determination remained at this model considers the effects of seasonal of the exchange of market prices inflation and of the the projection for the spread over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the copom increased from an average of basis points in the first quarter of to basis points in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were inflation expectations remain anchored at the target established by the cmn for the since the january copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations slightly decreased to from as mentioned in prior copom this fact suggests that the recent monetary policy stance has both contained inflationary pressures and contributed to the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period decreased relative to the forecast presented in the january remaining below the inflation target for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange rate and selic rate trajectories on the eve of the meeting continued above the target for the despite lower than the january for the benchmark forecast remained below the inflation but increased compared to on the other the forecast under the market scenario remaining above the inflation monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that current and expected inflation demonstrate that the monetary stance adopted since september has contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic economic activity has recovered momentum at a pace consistent with supply such that it will not trigger significant inflationary in despite continued volatility in international financial markets and the persistence of high oil the external environment remains particularly with regard to brazilian external financing a benign inflation environment continues to as in the january the committee emphasizes that the main challenge for monetary policy is to ensure the consolidation of these favorable the uninterrupted convergence of inflation to the target path and the resulting consolidation of a long lasting macroeconomic stability will contribute to the progressive reduction in perceived macroeconomic a process already underway for several the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally the committee considers that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the target for this to it is important that inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation in this the gradual monetary easing will not compromise the important achievements made in reducing inflation and preserving economic growth with job creation and rising real considering the current the copom unanimously decided to continue the monetary easing process started in september three members of the copom voted for a decrease of the selic rate to according to their would better signal the magnitude of the overall improvement of the risks associated to inflation dynamics between the january and march current risks point to a sustained pickup of the with good perspectives for fixed capital investment and imports and also reflect the dampening of the january inflation the members of the committee that voted for a more expressive interest rate cut that the next steps in the monetary policy strategy depend on future inflation developments and inflation the majority of the members of the copom were concerned about the enhanced uncertainties regarding the monetary transmission its lags and future outcomes given the basis points reduction in the selic rate implemented since in light of the reduced difference between the current selic rate and the equilibrium those members understood that the improvement of the risks observed between the january and march meetings would justify a cut in the selic this reduction would contribute to increase the intensity of the monetary adjustment process the copom decided by votes to to decrease the selic rate target to without at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on april for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased to in from in prices increased while food prices rose in the previous fuel alcohol prices increased due to the increase in consumption and the sugar cane contributing to the ipca urban bus fares contributed reflecting the fares readjustments implemented in rio de janeiro and belo health plans and vehicles also contributed to the ipca while energy prices declined due to the elimination of the emergency capacity the february

in the sectors of construction inputs and intermediate goods in the sector of capital the nuci stood at while in the sector of consumer it stood at the difference between the proportion of companies that reported excess inventories and those which reported insufficient inventories fell in similarly to what occurred in according to the confederation of national industry adjusted by the the nuci stood at in compared to in the recent process of retreat in the rates of installed capacity utilization in the reduction in the pace of production growth and the maturity of in the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through december until while the production of construction inputs increased until the trade balance surplus on a accumulated basis increased from billion in january to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the last twelve months through the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months increased from billion in december to billion in january equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in twelve months through equivalent to of global economy faces a period of still showing deteriorated prospects for despite some at the and lower level of risk since the last a more positive perception about the activity in the united states has but such as the recent increase in oil prices and the prospect of fiscal constraint the provision of additional liquidity by the european central bank seems to have in the short the probability of extreme banking but the risks to global financial stability remain among due to international banks exposure to sovereign debts of countries with fiscal imbalances as reflected in still despite price levels for credit default swaps and revision of ratings given to several mature economies by credit rating high persistent unemployment coupled with the need for fiscal the limited scope for anticyclical policy actions and the political have in for the reduction of growth projections in mature countries or even of their potential indicating a wider and more volatile economic in the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for reinforced signs of activity recovery in the but showed increase in the probability of recession in the euro disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for related to activity in point to a slightly more benign global scenario and asymmetry among regarding monetary mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary complemented by monetary policy initiatives by the the bank of england and bank of japan regarding the core measures have persisted at moderate levels in the us and in the euro in emerging in monetary policy bias is the price of brent oil barrel remained volatile and breached the in greater political instability in some important producing countries and lags in the process of production it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the upward movement for agricultural and metal international prices since the last copom with respective increases of and when measured by the commodity research bureau compared to the peak recorded in april the cumulative decline in both categories stands at and the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers accumulated a fall of until since the peak observed in february with a monthly increase of in in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in fx it is plausible to affirm that the announcement by chinese authorities of reduced growth targets tends to generate some impact on commodities of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline and bottled gas for were maintained at the same value considered at the january the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and for were maintained at and the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark was maintained at the same value considered at the january the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark decreased to down from considered at the january copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus target around of without a primary surplus of around of gdp is considered for without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the change in the ipca weighting which will take place in january the projections were developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that identify in a broader manner the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the brazilian economy among imports prices and external volatility as a working the main scenario considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international part of this estimated impact is already being observed in the most recent economic activity since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased to from for the median of inflation expectations increased to from specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians of expectations for the ipca changed to and from and for the medians changed to and from and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the january copom and it stands below the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for also retreated and stands around the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection rose in the reference scenario and shows relative stability in the market in both cases positioned above the midpoint policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since the last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic the committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain it also notes in these there seems to be limited scope for using monetary and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming for important emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external through the external trade in specific changes in the growth pattern are a development that tends to be the committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among the reduction of total the moderation in investment flows and tighter credit the committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment add up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic which is for in the retreat of growth projections for the brazilian economy in this and in the upcoming in other the moderation process the brazilian economy was already experiencing in the first half of last year was intensified by the weakness of the global the copom evaluates although domestic demand expansion has prospects for economic activity are this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that notwithstanding the accommodation at the stands at historically high the copom that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve which started to retreat in the last tends to continue the decline to move towards the targets the committee evaluates by the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic especially those of the price about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming the committee believes that this improvement in the perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity both domestic and in this and in the upcoming the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the adoption of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the in other is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the committee also observes in commodities prices in international markets have shown benign the copom considers that the deceleration of the brazilian economy in the second half of was higher than that recent events indicate the postponement of a final solution for the european financial and that the risks associated to the deleveraging process stemming from families and government under way in major economic blocs these and other constitute an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level for the the prospective scenario for since the last has accumulated favorable the committee also notes according to the main scenario the inflation rate stands around the target in and assess as decreasing the risks for the materialization of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint in since the last monetary policy committee the main scenario for inflation has in general as then expected by the it does not detect significant changes in the estimates for the total adjustment of monetary conditions underlying this in light of two members of the committee consider that it would be opportune the maintenance of the pace of adjustment of the selic the majority argues that developments such as the ones mentioned in the previous paragraph at this the redistribution along time of the total adjustment of monetary conditions as the most appropriate in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom decided to decrease the selic rate to without with five votes for the monetary policy action and two votes in favor of reducing the selic rate by basis the copom evaluates that domestic demand is still especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and on the other the committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the substantial and persistent deterioration in the international these elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in the interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the cycles specific and temporary reversions can occur and contribute for the brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral according to the are largely permanent in light of the and considering the values projected for the inflation and the associated balance of the copom attributes high probability for the materialization of a scenario that considers the selic rate moving to slightly above the historic lows and stabilizing at these at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on april for the technical and on the following day to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the rose in

regarding monetary advanced economies have persisted with strongly accommodative in emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and negative in the price of brent oil barrel has remained above since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom the international prices of metallic and agricultural commodities have decreased respectively and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a fall of in twelve months through january assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price in was maintained at unchanged relative to the last copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly down from considered at the january copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions recently as well as readjustments and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this fixed telephone tariff and bottled gas prices are projected to remain for the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was decreased to down from considered at the january copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the january copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus of according to parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for as a working a primary surplus of around of gdp is the set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations remained stable at specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed from and to and for the median of expectations changed from and to and in the same the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the january copom meeting and stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast also increased and stands above the midpoint inflation for inflation forecast increased relative to the january copom meeting and stands above the midpoint inflation in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom understands that there were significant structural changes in the brazilian which determined retreat in interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction in risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the ninth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public for the all these transformations are characterized by high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding according to the are largely permanent have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic in this despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity remained in mature the space to use monetary policy seems to be limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the next in important emerging the activity pace has supported by the resilience of domestic the committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of international commodities the copom evaluates that the pace of recovery in domestic economic activity less intense than previously anticipated is essentially due to limitations regarding the supply given their these cannot be addressed by monetary policy which par demand control on the other the committee highlights that recent information points to the investment resumption and to a growth path more aligned with potential the committee notices that domestic demand will continue to be boosted by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently as well as by the moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and domestic activity will continue to be favored by public as well as by the labor market which is reflected in historically low unemployment rates and in wage despite some accommodation at the the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit the copom emphasizes that its main scenario includes more intense domestic activity this in this the committee highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the copom emphasizes moderation recently observed in the prices dynamics of some real and financial in the assumption of remaining at the current will constitute important disinflationary the copom evaluates that the greater dispersion of consumer price increases recently seasonal pressures and pressures localized in the transportation among other contribute for inflation to show although this unfavorable dynamics may not represent a temporary but a possible accommodation of inflation at a higher the committee considers that remaining uncertainties stemming from foreign and domestic fronts surround the prospective scenario and recommend that monetary policy should be administered with in this assessing the macroeconomic outlook and the inflation the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and for the these the programs of public services the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of confidence create prospects for investment the committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector in expansionist on the other the committee notes that the still fragile international scenario represents an aggregate demand restraining these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian shows that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening the planning horizons of businesses and as well as in the deterioration of the the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income in this the committee will monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to then define the next steps in its monetary policy at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on april for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the changed in compared to in totaling an increase of in the twelve months

international reserves totaled with expansion of million and million in the there was no intervention in the spot having the central bank paid purchases of billion in repurchase lines in the domestic exchange market and open market operations after the january copom the domestic yield curve had an increase throughout its among the factors underpinning this it bears on the domestic the disclosure of more pressured price indices and the market expectation for the start of the selic target increase between january and march and interest rates increased by and the rates for and maturities increased by and the real interest measured by the ratio between the nominal interest rate and the inflation expectation for the next twelve increased from on january to on march mainly due to the rise in nominal on january the bcb carried out traditional fx swap auctions maturing on march in an amount equivalent to on february and the bcb carried out reverse fx swap maturing on march which totaled neutralizing its net position in fx swap in its open market the bcb carried out between january and march repurchase agreements with maturities of three and six borrowing the amounts of billion and the average daily balance of the operations increased from billion between november and january to between january and march in the same the bcb also borrowed money through operations with

between november and january to billion between january and march considering the operations for the most recent the total outstanding of repurchase agreements decreased from billion on january to billion on march the main factors that contributed to the contraction of liquidity in the period were the net revenues of the government and the net issuance of securities by the national between january and march the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions totaled the sale of securities reached of which billion in ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and the sales of lfts totaled with the issuance of securities maturing in in the auctions of securities maturing in and were totaling ipca inflation slightly declined in january and reached down from in the previous month and in the same month of last the january result stood slightly below expectations registered on the eve of the ipca and slightly above the expectations that prevailed at the end of inflation deceleration in january was mainly driven by the behavior of regulated which increased down from in market prices increased up from in december prices contributed up from in while tradable prices accounted for only down from in the previous amongst market the sharpest increases were for ethanol and perishable food recent developments suggest the reversal of this services inflation stood at in significantly above the december result but below the january figure trailing inflation decelerated in january to down from in market prices inflation totaled prices inflation contributed while prices inflation accounted for whilst regulated prices reached services inflation fell to in down from in according to the same comparison partial february already captured by the and underlying inflation suggest that inflation may be despite the recent inflation acceleration observed at the end of and the start of the most likely scenario is that inflation evolves according to the targets ipca core inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased in on a core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices totaled in up from in december and in smoothed trimmed means which had increased to in december from in reached and continued to record the strongest rigidity among the three core after increasing to in december from in the trimmed means core increased again to in despite the recent the cores continue to present a downward trend on a according to this comparison the inflation cores recorded and in compared to and in the general price index inflation accelerated to in up from in but decreased to in on a trailing after reaching in january the first fall observed since may the inflation accelerated to in virtually unchanged relative to suggesting accommodation of the components behaved similarly to the headline index at the start of the increasing in january and decreasing in on a the increased in january from in and in the wholesale price index inflation increased in january from in and in the increased in january from in and in on a trailing the decreased to in january down from in the first deceleration in the last eight according to this comparison this behavior suggests that the relative price adjustment observed during the last months of mainly driven by agricultural prices seems to have come to an as mentioned in the last inflation as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation gross domestic product grew in accelerating in the fourth both compared to the same quarter of the previous year and on a according to ibge seasonally adjusted gdp increased and compared to the same quarter of above the observed in the third data from the second and third quarters were indicating a growth elevation for considering the historical for the first time since the end of economic activity has grown for thirteen consecutive when compared to the same quarter of the previous suggesting the consolidation of the expansion on the supply gdp expanded by in the agriculture in industry and in after presenting unsatisfactory growth in and on the first half of agriculture rebounded in the second half of last expanding more than the other regarding the industrial it bears emphasizing the performances of mining and civil construction regarding the retail activity growing by on the demand gross fixed capital formation an outstanding growing by second best result in the last nine household consumption also mainly due to the income growth and positive credit market imports volume increased significantly in line with in contrast to pessimist expectations of the start of exports volume expanded by industrial according to ibge seasonally adjusted decreased by in this result was strongly influenced by technical interruptions in petrobras despite trending sideways through the first nine months of manufacturing production grew in the last three months of the signs of industrial activity for manufacturing production expanded in all three months of last for the first time since october three consecutive positive industrial production increased by in with expansions of for manufacturing industry and for capital goods production expanded by while durable goods production expanded by industrial activity expanded for the tenth consecutive month in january on a seasonally adjusted moving average despite some deceleration at the for leading and coincident indicators suggest several incentive including the monetary easing already implemented and the fiscal suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall accelerate in disaggregated industrial data showed seasonally adjusted expansions of in capital goods production and in durable consumer goods production in this result points to the in of the robust performance for gross fixed capital formation observed last on the other intermediate goods production contracted in after two consecutive monthly due to technical interruptions in the production of fuel and compared to the same month last all categories with highlights to the expansions of capital goods production the expansion of durable consumer goods production among other the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of the strong expansion of capital goods production reflects both the activity positive prospects for domestic growth and favorable international prices in the purchase of goods destined to several labor market performance remains with employment and income the unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan areas reached in porto rio de janeiro and salvador recorded the lowest rates for december months since the start of the ibge the unemployment rate increased to in in line with the seasonal similarly to the january the unemployment rate stability results from the expansion rate for both the number of employed people and the labor the number of formal workers in private sector grew whereas the number of informal workers decreased in compared to the same month last indicating that the pace of formal jobs creation remains with positive effects over labor market conditions and labor still in real average earnings fell a and increased over the same month last in real payrolls increased in january over the same month last sustaining the positive growth according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment increased a seasonally adjusted in for a growth over the last thirteen consecutive months of except for the stability observed in june regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirms the continuity of the ongoing despite the reduction of jobs in a usual performance for this formal job creation reached totaling more than formal jobs in the last three the number of formal jobs expanded by in due to the expansions of in civil in the retail in services and in the industry in january jobs were totaling almost a expansion over the same month last in the twelve months through formal job creation grew with highlights to civil construction and the retail sector whereas manufacturing employment increased by retail sales decreased in december according to seasonally adjusted ibge this reduction interrupted a expansion which totaled a even including the december the quarterly index increased or in annualized retail sales grew in compared to the same month of last and in this increase was mainly driven by and supermarket sales influenced by labor and income positive and furniture and domestic appliances sales as a result of increased payroll and better credit the main negative driver was fuel and lubricants which registered a despite the increase in the sales of expanded retail which include the sales of civil construction material and parts and increased in december compared to december in expanded retail sales increased by mainly as a result of the performance in the second half of the year of in the first half and in the second half of the to the same periods the previous considering that the factors that have been boosting private consume such as the positive outcomes stemming from the increase in real credit expansion and the lagged effects of the monetary easing retail sales results in december are in line with the usual pattern of high frequency and do not necessarily sign a downturn in retail sales in the vehicle sales performance observed at the start of corroborates robust domestic installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry in stood below that observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry reached in up from in the same month of disaggregated indicators compiled by the fgv show utilization rates at historically high levels for capital goods and civil the lower installed capacity utilization recorded in partially reflects improvements in the productive in recent data regarding output and absorption of capital goods suggest a robust ongoing expansion of the absorption of capital goods expanded by in the last quarter of resulting in the significant increase in this result was mainly driven by the increases of capital goods imports volume and at a but robust capital goods production despite the expectation of aggregate demand expansion in relevant aggregate supply imbalances that could jeopardy the inflation targets are not anticipated in the coming as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand similarly to the results observed at the start of the trade balance continues to frustrate the less optimistic recording robust results at the start of on the the trade surpluses have gradually been as in in the trade surplus reached lower than that observed in the same period last despite this exports reached a billion record high in the first two months of a increase over the same period of in the twelve months through exports reached also a record imports reached us billion in the first two months and billion in the last twelve both historical record imports have been growing more than exports on the as a result of the domestic demand robust trade results are expected to continue in these favorable track records corroborate the analysis expressed in previous copom minutes regarding important structural changes in brazilian external the current account surplus stood at million in totaling billion in or of in the current account surplus reached for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of with regard to the international uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy stance in the us although additional interest rate increases cannot be the consensus points to the fact that the bulk of the us domestic interest rate increase may have already on the other it seems to have been an increase in the market sensibility to data indicating a more pronounced slowdown in the us this slowdown was the focus of the volatility increase that characterized the international financial markets in the last although uncertainties regarding asian economies and markets have contributed as in these global financial markets instability and their consequences to the brazilian asset prices do not characterize a crisis environment both due to its transitory causes and to the solid brazilian macroeconomic the continued robust and persistent trade the accumulation of international adequate public primary improved public domestic debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to external this increase in resilience to shocks was reflected in the fact that the brazilian growth trend has been kept even in the context of interest rate adjustment in the industrialized the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external the international oil prices recovered in the last after a strong decline before the last copom in oil prices still present high among other geopolitical tensions and climatic despite this increased volatility in the oil the main scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in continues of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the january copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at considering the same comparison the projection for fixed telephone price adjustments in remained at while the projection for household electricity price adjustments decreased to from the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at these according to the weights released by the represent of the total january the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at the same projection presented in the last copom this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the fourth quarter of reaching in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the january copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group decreased to from this reduction was mainly driven by the incorporation of the january inflation rate and a decrease of inflation expectations for the first quarter of the ahead inflation expectations decreased to down from for inflation expectations were maintained in as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period was maintained compared to the values considered at the january copom remaining below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting situated below the values considered in the january copom meeting and below the central target for the the projection for in the benchmark was maintained in relation to the january remaining below the in the market despite the projection for was it still remains above the policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data still do not suggest high probability of important pressures over inflation in the imports expansion has contributed significantly to this domestic production limiting potential inflationary effects of aggregate demand sustained despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international due to the interest rates increase in industrialized and the recent and probably temporary volatility increase in the global the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market the prospects for the inflation trajectory remain as in the january the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the the copom evaluates that the inflation increase has been mainly determined by such as public transportation fares and food seasonal such as higher education impacted preliminary february inflation since these effects have not exhausted upcoming inflation indicators will likely continue to reflect those due to the nature of such they are expected to be with decreasing intensity throughout without necessarily affecting the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the second half of the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in and expected for this the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the signs of heated aggregate inflation and the fact that the monetary policy decisions should have concentrated effects in the second half of in in light of the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission the lower distance between the current selic rate and the equilibrium interest and the interest rate cuts implemented since september the copom members understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real demands a more cautious monetary easing given the reasons stated the copom unanimously decided to continue the monetary easing started in the september and reduce the selic target rate to without under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price the international scenario remains but presents new elements of uncertainty and on the other a set of price apparently arises when domestic demand already expands in such monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on april for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom ipca inflation increased in down from in the previous the slight decline was mainly driven by the lower increase in transportation which contributed against a increase in on the other prices of food and beverages accelerated up from in the previous primarily due to the increase in the prices of perishable goods that mirrored the effect of the rainy with the monthly the ipca totaled in the last twelve down from at the end of market prices inflation reached in up from in while regulated prices inflation totaled down from in the same trailing market prices inflation increased with tradable and goods prices rising by and while regulated prices inflation stood at in the same all three ipca core inflation measures increased in january on a all of them sustained a declining trend on a trailing the trimmed means core reached in up from in reaching in twelve for the first time below the lower limit of the inflation the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at in up from in totaling in twelve the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in up from in the previous for a increase in the last twelve the increased in totaling in the last twelve all the components of the index decelerated in the ipa prices the with the largest weight in the decelerated to down from in the reached in against in the previous mainly due to the dampening of education the core under the symmetric trimmed means method calculated by fgv stood at in february against in totaling in the twelve months through the increased in down from in due to reductions in the costs of labor force down from and services and materials down from the increased in the last twelve months through january and in the last twelve months through the lower ipa inflation in february reflected the deceleration in industrial considering that agricultural prices remained roughly stable during the the agricultural ipa grew in up from in the previous while the industrial ipa totaled considering the three processing stages of only intermediate goods recorded a negative price variation in which was rather in line with the rate observed in the prices of final goods grew in after a elevation in the prices of raw materials decelerated to after a increase in the previous in twelve the prices of raw materials increased by pressuring the ipa the prices of intermediate and final goods rose by and partial february already captured by underlying inflation show that inflation in february should be lower than the one measured in as shown by both and perishable food prices decelerated significantly and industrial prices presented negative change at the wholesale the grew against in the previous consumer price regarding the the ipcbr increased in down from in as a consequence of the fact that six out of seven classes of expenditures with regard to the the deceleration of the was not that against in this deceleration was mainly driven by the prices of which increased in up from in as a consequence of seasonal increases of tuition fees concentrated in economic activity gdp grew in spread out among all its regarding the production and services expanded by and on the demand there were increases in gross fixed capital formation household consumption government consumption exports and imports the external sector contributed to the gdp while domestic demand and stocks were responsible for and according to monthly retail sales decreased in on a seasonally adjusted all activities composing the general index decreased on a monthly and only out of the brazilian states recorded growth for retail compared to

temporary and should be overcome in the short since the global economy dynamic does not signal a significant change at the end of especially in the united states and in there are no evident signals that the financial markets experience liquidity which is determined by the low interest rates established by the central banks of the main economic indicators released in the such as consumer spending

february money market and open market operations the day after the january copom the yield curve shifted slightly with the rates adjusting to the decrease in the selic target and the rates influenced by the negative behavior of stock since then through february the yield curve shifted downward in the domestic the favorable inflation decreasing inflation expectations and the appreciation of the exchange rate reasoned this in the external the release of the fomc statement and the speeches of the fed governor in the congress boosted the investors favoring capital flows for emerging and contributing to a sharper decrease of the side of the yield this reduction was partially due to higher volatility in international financial markets in light of uncertainties regarding the deceleration pace of the us the chinese stock exchange fall and the movement of reverting long positions in several particularly in between january and march and rates declined and and rates reduced and the real interest rate measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectations were maintained at on february the bcb conducted a

since the last copom meeting show prospects of economic activity stabilization in the short in there are signs of interruption in the fall of investment and industrial this evidence is corroborated by some early signs of improvement in future prospects for economic such as the expectations components of confidence indexes and expectations for growth in compiled in the focus the economy continues to operate with a high level of idle reflected in industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment regarding the external the united decision to leave the european union was followed by a brief period of asset price signs of additional stimulus by monetary authorities of some developed economies contributed to stabilize financial markets and to create a relatively benign environment for emerging economies in the short the dynamics of the global economic recovery remain with uncertainty regarding growth and deflationary risks in major developed the possible economic consequences of brexit contributed to an increase in and uncertainty and produced downward revisions in growth forecasts for the united kingdom and the euro in the united the has signaled it will proceed more gradually in the normalization of its monetary the paths for the interest rate under appropriate policy reported by its members remain above the path inferred from financial which might lead to corrections in the returning to the domestic price indexes showed inflation exceeding expectations in the short due to food price increases to more persistent these results contributed to an increase in expectations for inflation measured by the focus unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the previous copom gross domestic federal open market extended consumer price stood at around as for ipca inflation expectations reported in the same survey have declined by approximately percentage point since the last copom the conditional in the scenarios for inflation produced by the committee remained relatively stable over the relevant for monetary policy since the last copom but declined relative to forecasts published in the last inflation for regulated the committee forecasts an increase of in lower than the forecast in the june copom for the current forecast of a increase in regulated prices is higher than the forecast in the last copom the reference scenario points to inflation around the target of already in this scenario among other that the interest rate and exchange rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast horizon per annum and it is worth noting that the same does not occur under the assumptions of the market which imposes the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the focus according to this inflation for stands at around in the baseline scenario contemplates disinflation in the brazilian economy in the upcoming for the projections under the reference and market scenarios point to inflation close to for disinflation towards the target occurs under the assumptions of the reference in the market disinflation evolves at a slower pace than the one pursued by the the copom uses the term to emphasize that the forecasts in the reference and market scenarios depend on conditioning assumptions for the future paths of the policy rate and the exchange among other the copom uses the term for the conduct of monetary policy to refer to the period of time until a change in monetary conditions implemented at a given point in time attains its maximum estimated effect on central do brasil risks around baseline inflation scenario there are risks to inflation in the recent increase in food prices can show given the transmission process from wholesale prices into retail favorable seasonality may contribute to a fast reversion of these on the one prolonged periods of high inflation and such as in the recent brazilian tend to reinforce inertial mechanisms and make the disinflation process slower and in this greater inflationary persistence requires greater monetary policy on the other the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity in produce faster disinflation for in the services sector than the one reflected in the inflation expectations measured by the focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the the implementation of the necessary adjustments in the including those of fiscal presents itself as both a risk and an opportunity for the ongoing disinflationary the risks would materialize if there were a perception that adjustments would be abandoned or postponed in this the disinflationary process would tend to be increasing the costs of bringing inflation to on the other the necessary adjustments in the economy can be approved and implemented more enabling confidence gains and falling inflation in this the reduction of uncertainty would boost the effects of the ongoing monetary adjustment there are risks that are inherent to the conduct of monetary the latter impacts the economy with variable and uncertain it is thus expected even under appropriate realized inflation will fluctuate around this is due to the substantial uncertainty associated with inflation projections in the relevant which arises naturally from the incidence of favorable and unfavorable shocks to the economy over the committee should seek to conduct monetary policy so that inflation including in the market point to the inflation target in the relevant discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members agreed that there was a noticeable improvement in the macroeconomic scenario and that recent indicators show prospects for the stabilization of economic activity in the near this perspective is corroborated by the improvement in some indicators of economic regarding the committee members also agreed that progress has been the ongoing disinflation process has

the balance sheets of major central the possibility of additional stimuli in created a benign period for such all members of the committee highlighted the presence of and risks in the external associated with the fragility of the global economic in some developed factors may pose tail despite more reassuring signs by the fomc all members of the committee agreed on the need to monitor the pace of monetary policy normalization in the united some members argued that the eventual end of the benign period for emerging economies can pose a risk in all members of the monetary policy committee emphasized that the continuation of efforts for approval and implementation of adjustments in the especially with regard to fiscal is essential to facilitate and reduce the cost of the disinflation there was no consensus on the speed of these which suggests that they may constitute both a risk and an all members agreed that the implications of the adjustment process in the economy for inflation dynamics depend not only on the impact of shortterm measures on aggregate but also on the perception of improved dynamics of public finances in the medium and long the members of the committee highlighted that the fiscal central do brasil process may involve measures with unfavorable direct effects on and this is a risk to be the debate on the balance of risks to inflation also focused on the degree of confidence regarding the ongoing disinflation for shorter the emphasis fell on recent food price increases and on the discrepancy of approximately between inflation expectations calculated by the focus survey and the projections produced by the monetary policy committee for the current for longer the committee members discussed the effects of the level of spare capacity and the still inflation in they highlighted possible implications of the current scenario for the sensitivity of inflation especially in the service sector to the level of economic as well as for inflation dynamics in particular its inertial some members reasoned given the economic slowdown experienced so a greater decline in inflation was other members drew attention to the disinflation in services prices already some members of the committee expect that the disinflationary effects stemming from the level of economic slack may yet manifest themselves more in this all committee members acknowledged progress on the disinflation prospects of the brazilian but expressed concern with the inflation expectations measured by the focus which stand above the and with the projections for inflation under the assumptions of the market which are also above the target for horizons of months or monetary policy decision the copom concluded taken the baseline scenario and the current balance of risks indicate no room for monetary the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes

changed from billion in april to billion in to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of global economy faces a period of with high risk and prospects of low which have intensified since the last copom in this data suggest some cooling of the activity in the united states in a scenario of risks associated to the fiscal outlook and to the deepening of the european heightened risks to global financial stability remain due to the still high level of political uncertainty and to the difficulties of implementing the recently announced high rates of unemployment for a long coupled with the need for fiscal the limited scope for countercyclical policy actions and the political uncertainty are translated into projections of low growth for mature the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to indicates activity below trend in the euro area and in the main emerging besides moderation of activity in japan and in the in the same the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for june suggest moderation in global mainly in manufacturing regarding monetary advanced economies persist with strongly accommodative stances the european central bank reduced the interest rate to the lowest historical and the bank of england resumed measures of quantitative core inflation measures have remained at moderate levels in the in the euro area and in in emerging in the monetary policy bias is which in some with additional countercyclical in china in june and two consecutive cuts in the reference interest rates for deposits and the price of brent oil barrel has oscillated around since the last copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom international prices of metallic commodities fell while those related to agricultural commodities increased relative to the record highs observed in april the changes reach and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulated a fall of until compared to the peak recorded in february in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was influenced by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in fx it is plausible to affirm that the reduction of growth targets in coupled with the fragility of the global tends to generate downward pressures over commodities of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline and bottled gas for were maintained at the same value considered at the may copom the projected adjustment for for fixed telephone was reduced to compared to considered at the may copom and for was increased to up from considered at the may the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was reduced to down from considered at the may copom the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the may copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus around of without it is as a working a primary surplus of billion for of without according to parameters set out in the draft budget guidelines law for it is as a working a primary surplus of of without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last the main scenario does not include the occurrence of extreme events in international financial and considers the estimates of the impacts caused by changes in the external environment on the brazilian since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased from to for the median of inflation expectations also reduced from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed to and from and for the median changed to and from and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the may copom meeting and it stands around the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for remained stable around the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection reduced in both but still stands above the midpoint target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investments and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those deriving from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic the committee understands the prospects of more moderate global activity than previously anticipated have and the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed it also notes in these there seems to be limited leeway for monetary policy and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming in important emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external in specific changes in the growth pattern tend to be until the committee evaluates that the international scenario has shown disinflationary for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among moderation of total moderation in investment flows and tighter credit another transmission channel of great importance is the impact over businessmen the committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment added up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic the copom that although domestic demand expansion has also been prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are with some asymmetry among the several this assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit supply both for individuals and and by the fact that to a lesser stands at high the committee that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve which started to retreat in the last quarter of tends to continue the decline to move towards the targets the committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic especially price about the inflation dynamics in this and in the upcoming the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the committee considers that the recovery in domestic economic activity has materialized quite on the other it highlights that the main scenario encompasses more intense pace of activity this the committee identifies decrease in the probability of extreme events in international financial but at the same it argues that recent developments indicate postponement of a final solution for the european financial and that risks associated to the process of deleveraging of households and government now under way in the main economic blocs remain these and other an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level for the the prospective scenario for since the last maintained favorable the committee also notes according to the main scenario the inflation rate stands around the target in in the copom considers at the present the risks for the inflation trajectory remain the committee also notes until due to the global the external sector contribution has been in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and the committee considers that recent initiatives indicate scenario of neutrality of the public sector balance the committee notes that the still fragile international scenario presents itself as an important factor restraining aggregate these elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that the brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in the interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral according to the are largely permanent in light of the even considering that the activity recovery has occurred more slowly than the committee believes given the cumulative and lagged effects of policy actions implemented so any additional monetary easing movement should be conducted with at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on august for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in down from in totaling in the year and in twelve compared to in the twelve

from in the lowest level for the series since july the inflation decrease in the period was mainly driven by the fall in market prices and the slowdown in regulated the main price decreases were for transportation and food and with highlights to the persistent slowdown in the prices of perishable food and fuel a benign inflation scenario continues to evolve in line with the targets with favorable prospects for inflation in the coming all ipca core inflation measures fell in the similarly to the headline core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices fell to in down from in may and in trimmed means core fell to in june lowest level since november down from in may and in smoothed trimmed means core has reflected the and fell to in june lowest level since july down from in the three core measures continue to present a downward in line with headline inflation observed in the last on a trailing the core inflation by exclusion and the core inflation stood below the center of the similarly to the headline on the other the smoothed core inflation has converged more slowly to the reaching in the last twelve months ended in in contrast with consumer price the general price index increased to in up from in may and in for a increase in the first half of the compared to in the same period of last in the twelve months through the increased outweighing the deflation observed in the twelve months ended in april and the upturn was mainly driven by the acceleration in wholesale price after presenting deflation in the period ended in the increased in may and in the upturn reflected a sharp but not totally in agricultural prices and an increase in industrial after falling for four consecutive accumulating a decrease in the the agricultural ipa reached in despite this the agricultural ipa recorded in the twelve months through the fourteenth consecutive monthly on the other after remaining steady in the period ended in the industrial ipa increased in the period but reached only in the twelve months through wholesale price inflation may continue to positively influence consumer price inflation in the coming despite the recent dynamics of international commodities as emphasized in recent copom the continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation industrial output held steady in but grew a seasonally adjusted in according to data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics with this industrial output registered a new record above the last record reached in december on a moving average industrial output grew by and in april and industrial production expanded by in compared to the same month last after a fall in according to the same comparison in the first five months of the industrial output expanded by compared to the same period last which confirms the recovery trend started in the last quarter of this result confirms the expectation that industrial output in is expected to outperform on a trailing industrial production was kept unchanged at in april and close to the march industrial output recovery observed in the last months was already since the lagged effects of the monetary easing implemented since september start to materialize with more the adjustment of started in the second half of seems to be leading and coincident indicators suggest industrial output will contract in on a seasonally adjusted but expand on a threemonth moving average disaggregated industrial data show that durable consumer goods and capital goods grew by and in compared to the same month last intermediate goods which had been expanding at a slower pace than other grew a seasonally adjusted in more homogeneous expansion among all use categories suggests robust industrial in on a twelvemonth trailing capital goods production has outperformed that observed in in line with the last fgv which revealed that participants are more likely to invest in than they did in the previous in in the year through capital goods production grew by compared to the same period last durable goods production expanded at more intense pace among other the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of the unemployment rate decreased from in april to in the same level reached in may the average unemployment rate declined in the year through compared to the same period last notwithstanding the increase in labor in the average is a record since the start of the new evidences suggest a continuous improvement in the labor in line with the consolidation of macroeconomic this improvement positively impacted the purchase power of which increased a in and significant compared to the same month of reflecting the inflation deceleration in the according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment rose in april and in seasonally compared to the same periods last the expansion reached and in the twelve months through the expansion totaled according to the ministry of labor and employment formal employment also continues the ongoing formal employment grew a seasonally adjusted in may and in in the twelve months through it increased by virtually unchanged compared to the april mainly driven by the expansion in civil with the creation of jobs in may million in the last twelve formal job creation increased to ibge seasonally adjusted data recorded a increase in retail sales for after a rise in when compared to the same months of april and may sales expanded and in the year through sales expanded by compared to the same period last for a growth in the last twelve compared to may seven out of eight retail categories with highlights to the furniture and appliances which expanded this performance largely reflects expansion of sales that are more sensitive to income and but it also mirrors the favorable dynamics of sales expansion are expected to continue in the coming fostered by positive labor market and income credit expansion and the monetary easing as well as by the recovery in consumer confidence and the expansionary impacts of the minimum wage installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry increased for the second consecutive month to in from in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the in the year through the average installed capacity utilization stood below the levels registered in the same period of this decline partially reflects the improvements in the productive in recent data regarding absorption of capital goods and civil construction inputs suggest the expansion of in the year through capital goods absorption expanded by compared to the same period of the main contributors for this result were the increases in capital goods imports volume and in capital goods production civil construction inputs expanded by according to the same comparison despite favorable prospects for aggregate demand expansion in the coming relevant supply unbalances are not as stressed in previous inflation trend is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust results in confirming previous copom assessments regarding important structural changes in the brazilian external in the first half of trade balance reached virtually unchanged compared to the same period last in trailing surplus reached slightly above the previous but below the billion record high reached in this process was already expected and suggests the start of an adjustment dynamics for the trade even trailing exports reached billion in a new record high for the imports have also continued to reaching billion in according to the same comparison as a robust external results are expected in the current account surplus stood at million in for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of uncertainties regarding the length of the monetary policy tightening cycle in the us under these although some accommodation has occurred in the last international markets are still subject to abrupt with consequences for the composition of more these moves have heightened due to the increase of geopolitical this instability reflected in the price of several currencies against the us dollar and the risk premium in several emerging in between the first and fourth weeks of the exchange rate increased to from and the country risk measured by the jp morgan increased to from since the exchange rate and the country risk swung around and according to the the instability observed since the start of may does not represent a due to both the temporary causes and the solid domestic macroeconomic the continued robust and persistent trade accumulation of international adequate public primary improved public debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to the improvement in domestic resilience to shocks reflected the evidence that the domestic economy has sustained the growth trend the long monetary adjustment process in course in the the copom continues to assign a low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external another concern regarding the international scenario is the oil which lately reached record after trending sideways at elevated the recent hike reinforces the concern that oil prices may resist at levels above the previously as in previous the future oil prices trajectory still encompasses great but a significant downturn in prices seems less likely to the scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in has become less likely to and the risks related to its materialization have increased in apart from the effects of an increase in domestic fuel the elevation in international oil prices affects the domestic economy through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of market inflation of inflation trends the inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following the projection for gasoline prices adjustments in remained unchanged at on the other the projection for bottled gas prices adjustments in increased to from the projection for household electricity adjustments in decreased to from while the projection for fixed line telephone adjustments in declined to from for all regulated the copom decreased to from the adjustment projection for these according to the weights released by the represent of the total june the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on the endogenous determination remained at this model considers the effects of seasonal of the exchange of market prices inflation and of the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the third quarter of reached in the last quarter of and in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the may median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investors relations group decreased to from this reduction was mainly driven by the incorporation of the may and june ipca monthly significantly below the expected in the may ahead inflation expectations increased to from for inflation expectations remained in line with the target established by the as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period decreased relative to the forecast presented in the may remaining below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange rate and selic rate trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting also declined relative to the may forecast and stood below the target for the for the benchmark forecast increased compared to but still remained below the inflation on the other the forecast under the market scenario remained virtually and above the inflation target established by the policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that current and expected inflation demonstrate that the monetary stance adopted since september has both contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic economic activity has recovered momentum at a pace consistent with supply such that it will not trigger significant inflationary in despite continued volatility in international financial markets due to uncertainties regarding the monetary policy in developed countries and the record highs reached by oil the external outlook remains particularly with regard to brazilian external financing a benign inflation environment continues to despite the likely reversal of favorable factors that subdued and the increased risk stemming from important commodity as in the may the committee emphasizes that the main challenge for monetary policy is to ensure the consolidation of these favorable the uninterrupted convergence of inflation to the target path and the resulting consolidation of a long lasting macroeconomic stability will contribute to the progressive reduction in perceived macroeconomic a process already underway for several the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally the committee considers that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the target for this to it is important that inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation the copom emphasizes that there are important lags in monetary policy transmission to economic activity and since the start of the monetary easing in september the committee has reduced the selic rate by basis the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the recent activity resumption on inflation have not completely in the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in the may activity level should also reflect the effects of the new minimum wage and the fiscal impulse of the last quarter of and first half of the effects of interest rates cuts will add up to other factors that will contribute to demand given the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission and the reduced difference between the current selic rate and the equilibrium the copom understood that the maintenance of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real may demand a more cautious monetary easing this argument is even more relevant in light of the fact that the monetary policy decisions in the coming months will produce concentrated impacts for the unanimously decided to continue the monetary easing process begun in the september and reduce the selic target rate to without and closely follow the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next at which time it will define the next steps in its monetary policy under an the monetary authority decides according to the prospective analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price even considering that the recent heightened volatility in international financial markets may be it increased the uncertainty surrounding the future path of so that both the monetary assessment of scenarios and the coordination of private sector expectations became more in such an the monetary authority must remain vigilant so that pressures do not contaminate longer time in case of an exacerbation of the risk factors monitored by the the monetary policy strategy will be promptly adapted to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on august for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca decreased in the lowest monthly change since september and the third lowest three out of the nine surveyed groups presented negative change in transportation household items and food the fall in fuel alcohol prices and its direct impact on gasoline prices contributed for the ipca while perishable food contributed the ipca rose by in the first half of and in the last twelve regulated prices grew in june and in the last twelve while market prices dropped by and increased by in the same tradable and prices decreased and in and and in the last twelve in the increased for changes of in the first half of and in twelve among its the the with the largest weight in the increased in after posting in for changes of in the year through june and in the last twelve the declined to in favored by the continued downward trend of food which decreased a decline in and lower increases in items such as health and the incc also decelerated in increasing by down from in reflecting the reduced impact of wage the higher increase in wholesale prices in june was mainly due to the reversal in agricultural prices and the acceleration in industrial the agricultural ipa increased in june up from in mainly driven by the increases in the prices of sugar corn and industrial prices increased from in due to pressures stemming from nonferrous and wholesale prices also increased in june according to the processing ipa inflation for final goods prices declined to up from in while intermediate goods and raw material prices increased to and up from and in the previous all ipca core inflation measures declined in the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at compared to in for a rise in twelve the trimmed means core cooled to down from in for a expansion in twelve the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached down from in the previous for a expansion in twelve the core calculated by the fgv under the symmetric trimmed means cooled to in june down from in for expansions of in the year and in the last twelve the ipca diffusion index the number of items in the ipca registering price stood at in compared to in consumer inflation tends to decrease in although a reversal in the downward trend of food prices perishable and fuel alcohol prices is expected to economic activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the ibge retail sales increased in for a increase in the year through compared to the same period of the main drivers of this result were the growth in furniture and appliances sales and the growth in food and beverages sales and and são paulo trade association data showed a seasonally adjusted decline in database consultations for credit sales in june and a decrease in the number of usecheque in the first half of the these indicators expanded by and compared to the same period in the investment measured by the ratio between

calculated by the in the year through these indicators increased by and compared to the same period of the previous also in the year through capital goods production for energy increased for and of mixed while capital goods production for agriculture fell for industrial the production of serial equipment decreased while the production of equipment increased by in the same according to the monthly industrial survey industrial production increased a seasonally adjusted in above the record high registered in december in the year through industrial production expanded by compared to the

by and and goods production grew while durable goods production fell in the year through compared to the same period of all categories with highlights to durable goods production and capital goods production seasonally adjusted data for industrial production showed that of the sectors surveyed increased in with food and machines and equipment as the main drivers of the electronic communication equipment and other chemical products recorded sharp cni manufacturing data also showed continuity in manufacturing industry activity growth in despite at a slower hours worked increased and real industrial sales diminished on a seasonally adjusted in the year through both indicators increased and compared to the same period of installed capacity utilization reached a seasonally adjusted in

the overall business current outlook is considered better at the start of and the forecasts for the coming months are more optimistic than those of july current data ratify the industrial activity resumption observed since the start of the with improvement of the aggregate demand and adjusted inventory the forecasts for the coming months are more optimistic in with highlights to the improvement in the industrial employment and business overall market according to the ministry of labor and new jobs were created in spread among almost all activity on a seasonally adjusted formal employment increased mainly driven by the expansion in civil in the year through thousand new jobs were compared to the thousand jobs created in the same period of according to the ibge survey in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in below the april the decrease in the unemployment rate reflected the increase in the employed which more than offset the increase in the labor the average unemployment rate in the first five months of the year reached the lowest rate in the period since the start of the new in march real average earnings reached in increasing compared to april and compared to may real defined as the ratio between real average earning and the number of employed increased in the month and in the last twelve according to the cni seasonally adjusted by

june and in twelve credit for individuals rose in the month and in twelve personnel credit operations and credit to acquisition of vehicles grew and in twelve corporate credit operations with domestic funding increased in the month and in twelve while externally funded operations decreased in the month and increased in twelve driven by the brl appreciation and the settlement of the average interest rate on credit kept the downward trend in reaching below the june the average rate on credit for individuals decreased to down from while the average rate on corporate credit decreased to according to the same comparison delinquency rates in the financial system in arrears for more than ninety hit in delinquency rates for corporate credit operations reached while credit operations with individuals stood at net delinquency rates for retail measured by the stood at in down from in due to falls of in new registers and in cancelled in the first half of the the average default rate reached the same result of the first half of environment important developments in global economic such as more restrictive monetary policy measures in more industrialized combined with the in oil heightened instability and volatility in the markets in the last after the marked by the swings in the prices of the markets assumed a more cautious some assets had their prices favoring the emerging markets with more solid the perception of accommodation in the us economic with but controlled as highlighted in the last statement of the contributed to reduce the markets uncertainties regarding the coming decisions of the monetary authority especially because future economic indicators will drive at the these indicators point to a slow pace with high in japan and in the euro recent data point to the recovery of these in banking loans grew in june at a pace not observed since the last the tankan released positive results for in the euro the european central bank ratified that the economy continues to and the activity level is close to the potential in both there is evidence of a gradual upturn of the monetary foreign trade and international reserves in the first half of brazilian external trade confirmed the ongoing recording new record highs in exports and total external trade reached up from billion for the same period of in the the trade balance surplus reached million below the

the first compared to the same periods of at the end of international reserves stood at million below the previous money market and open market operations after the may the interest rate yield curve shifted downward for all between may and july and rates fell and driven by the copom statement and as well as by the release of favorable current inflation indices and inflation and rates fell respectively and driven by the in the external up to the rates when the volatilities of the international stock markets and the emerging market currencies as of that the rates especially after june fomc real interest rates measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectation declined to on july from on may on may the bcb conducted an

tradable goods increased in twelve months in january and the prices of in january on its the prices of food and beverages group increased in the same period in january and the prices of services rose in january in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying inflation calculated by the changed from in december to in as a on a trailing inflation reached above the one registered until january the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from in december to in the double weight core from to the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from to the nonsmoothed trimmed means core from to and the core by which excludes ten household food items and from to the diffusion index stood at in january below the one recorded in january the general price index increased in after increasing in and on a month trailing basis in the twelve months through january the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months until january with retreat of in the prices of agricultural products and increase of in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through january until january the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed until january partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in driven by the increase in the prices of oil and by in in the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimate for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in december the changed relative to december and increased in in on the other the composite purchasing index regarding brazil pointed to deceleration of the economic activity in with expansion in the manufacturing sector and decrease in the services on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation retreated in february and remains below its historical the industrial businessmen measured by the industry confidence index decreased in regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the calculated by the bcb based on a quarterly consultation carried out with institutions representing each segment of the credit the credit conditions indicators for the first quarter of compared to the last quarter of a small slowdown in the granting of concessions to due to both lower demand and to more restrictive regarding credit to the analysis indicates stability in the pace of credit approval destined to consumption and slight reduction to housing the industrial activity retreated by in after decreasing in according to the seasonally adjusted released by the industrial production in december stood below the one registered in december the industrial production in was above the with expansion in out of the surveyed the pmi of the industrial sector indicates expansion in with increase in the amount of new according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased in the number of hours the employment and real average among the use the production of capital goods increased in december compared to december at the same the production of intermediate durable consumer goods and semidurable and consumer goods decreased and in the same comparison regarding growth accumulated in there were expansions in the production of capital goods and durable consumer goods retreat in the production of semidurable and consumer goods and stability in the production of intermediate the ibge released the first results of the new national household sample survey according to the the unemployment rate in brazil in the second quarter of was representing a decrease of compared to the same quarter of the unemployment rate was higher in the northeast region of the labor and lower in the south region according to the monthly employment survey covering only six metropolitan the unemployment rate without seasonal adjustment was in representing a reduction of compared to the january according to the bcb seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached the record low of the historical series started in which partially reflects the reduction in the economically active population in the recent still according to the the average real income increased in while real payroll increased according to the same comparison data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were created in the net creation was similar to the one observed in january but significantly lower than the formal job creation observed in the same month in the previous three in the available data indicate narrow idleness margin in the labor although there are some signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the retail sales volume increased by in after expanding by in on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction increased by in after growing by in the previous in the sales volume increased in all ten sectors similarly to the observed in at the the retail sales changed by and broad retail by in according to the seasonally adjusted after five consecutive the trade confidence index measured by the retreated in mainly due to the moderation in the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in february in february according to the seasonally adjusted series calculated by the the nuci in february reached the utilization capacity in the sector of capital goods stood at in the sector of consumer intermediate goods and construction the utilization capacity stood at and on its the absorption of capital goods grew in of in while the production of inputs for the civil construction increased in the previous the trailing trade balance result reached billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in which diminished and increased compared to the previous twelve on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global the prospects point to more intense activity pace in important advanced specifically about despite recent high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements constraining investments and composite leading released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to and pmi coincident relative to january and signal improvements at the margin in important economies especially in the manufacturing sector with prospects of growth in line with the regarding the monetary the federal reserve continued the process of gradual reduction of the assets purchase in accommodative stances prevail in the advanced in the emerging the monetary policy is less and in some cases inflation remains at moderate or low levels in the in the euro zone and in the price of the brent oil barrel has increased since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural have increased while those relative to metals have decreased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations retreated in the twelve months through january of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline and bottled gas for the whole year of was maintained at the same value considered at the january copom the projected adjustment for the household electricity for the whole year of was maintained at the same value considered at the january copom the projected adjustment for the fixed telephone tariff for the whole year of was maintained at the same value considered at the january copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated for the whole year of was maintained at the same value considered at the january copom and the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices accumulated for the whole year of was maintained at the same value considered at the january copom these projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the estimated path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis point and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus both for and is considered as the fiscal according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca has remained at for the median of the inflation projections increased to from the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation remained relatively compared to the value considered at the previous copom and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast increased relative to the value considered at the january and stands above the inflation for according to the baseline the inflation forecast decreased regarding the figure considered at the january copom but is above the midpoint inflation according to the market the ipca inflation forecast remained stable relative to the value considered at the january meeting and is above the midpoint inflation policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the based on positive data recently the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have in there are improvements in advanced including countries from the euro in the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee also highlights despite localized recently the prospects indicate moderation in the dynamics of commodity prices in international as well as in the currency there is evidence of tension and the copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses relatively stable domestic activity expansion pace in this compared to and that recent information in the relevant horizon for the monetary changes in the composition of aggregate supply an the domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than gdp growth rates gradually converging according to the it tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy of the moderate expansion of credit supply of credit to of the program of public services concession and of the program of permission for oil among other for the the outlook that has been taking shape is that consumption would tend to keep but at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent and investments would gain regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates that more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture are emerging and considering the relevant horizon for the monetary the services sector tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and of their resulting gains depends on the strengthening of and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables and the arising of the conditions so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation on the one would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it should also be emphasized that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum wage this year is not as significant as in the previous and considering the occurrence over the recent quarters of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent semesters enable a natural and expected correction in relative for the the movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of the international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is also important to highlight for the the aforementioned exchange rate depreciation constitutes a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the secondary effects stemming from and that would tend to materialize over longer can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy the copom evaluates despite the moderation observed at the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show by the has been slightly above the level that was in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it be in this the copom considers that it is appropriate to continue the ongoing adjustment pace of the monetary continuing the adjustment process of the basic interest initiated at the april the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to be relatively on the one household consumption tends to continue due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other favorable financial concession of public expansion of oil exploration among create good prospects for these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the same the committee considers that the effects of monetary policy actions over inflation are cumulative and occur with at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on april for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june ipca inflation totaled in the same rate recorded in as regulated prices deceleration offset market prices as a average monthly inflation recorded in the second quarter of the down from in the first on the other ipca inflation totaled in the year through down from in the same period last with market prices recording and regulated compared to and in the same period last inflation has steadily totaling in up from in in april and in this acceleration was due to the substitution of more elevated inflation rates observed in the last months monthly for reduced inflation rates observed in the second quarter of monthly since market prices inflation has exceeded regulated prices inflation on a interrupting a trend observed for a long in these indicators reached and according to the same disaggregated data show that prices have driven market prices with figure through june reaching while tradable prices inflation stood at this fact despite significant deceleration in services totaling in the twelve months through down from observed in the same period of last notwithstanding the inflationary acceleration in the first half of the compared to the same period of the copom considers that inflation should continue to evolve according to the targets ipca core inflation measures did not in the declining headline inflation behavior in the second only one out of the three core inflation measures calculated by the bcb core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices averaged in the second down from in the first quarter of the on the other smoothed trimmed means and nonsmoothed trimmed means core inflation measures remained averaging and in the first half of significant reductions are when compared to the same period of core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices reached down from smoothed trimmed means core inflation totaled down from while trimmed means core inflation increased down from al three core measures stood below the headline inflation in the first half of the in the last twelve months through compared to the same period of last all inflation core measures showed significant core inflation by exclusion increased down from smoothed trimmed means core totaled down from and trimmed means core reached down from still on a trailing all three core inflation measures compared to the rates observed in but stood below the central target for the general price index inflation accelerated in the second quarter and reached in up from in may and in in the first half of the inflation reached up from in the same period of last this move was driven by the behavior of the consumer price which increased up from in the same period of while the civil construction national index remained virtually unchanged up from and the totaled in down from in in the last twelve months through the increased up from in june throughout the second the remained reflecting the increase in industrial prices and a heterogeneous behavior of agricultural which fell sharply from april through and recovered in the behavior of wholesale price inflation continues to in contradictory pressures stemming on the one the elevation of international prices of commodities and foodstuff on the other the strengthening of the as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation general industrial which encompasses extractivism and manufacturing accelerated in the last on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output grew in up from in considering the reviewed figures for general industrial output recorded the eighth consecutive monthly expansion in industrial output grew in compared to the same month last in the year through and in the last twelve with a trend of acceleration at the margin under the two last ibge data indicate that manufacturing industry also on a moving average the manufacturing industry output index increased by in in in april and in in the last twelve months through manufacturing industry expanded by while mining increased by among use capital goods production outperformed in the year through growing strongly by in the production of intermediate goods increased by in the same after growing below the average of general industrial output in the period for the leading and coincident indicators available for industrial production suggest the continuity of the growth the several incentive factors to economic including the monetary easing already suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall continue in the upcoming the unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan regions stood at in may for the third consecutive below the may in the year through the average unemployment rate reduced by compared to the same period last despite the slow decline in the unemployment the number of employed workers increased in the last twelve months through due to the growth of the economically active population a process usually present in moments of economic the purchasing power of employed workers increased in unchanged relative to the previous and relative to may in the year through it reached which contributed for the expansion of real according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in may and compared to may in the year through manufacturing employment robustly grew regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirm the continuity of strong with the creation of thousand new a record high for the month of since the start of the series in job creation grew seasonally adjusted expanding by in the year through june and in the last twelve thousand jobs were created in the first half of the up from thousand jobs in the same period of last year and million in the last twelve the copom considers that positive developments in the labor market will continue to be an important support channel to aggregate demand in the upcoming retail sales increased in the fifth consecutive according to data seasonally adjusted by the in the quarter ended in relative to the same period of last retail sales recorded real compared to in the quarter ended in while expanded retail which include the sales of civil construction material and parts and increased up from in in retail sales increased by compared to the same month of for a expansion in the year through in the last twelve expansion reached significant and has accelerated at the compared to may and domestic sales grew while clothing and grew by the steady performance of retail sales reflects both the expansion of income and employment and the improvement of consumer credit expanded retail sales recorded real growth in compared to the same month of the eleventh consecutive month that expanded retail sales exceeded retail for the rest of the it is expected the continuity of retail sales boosted by the increase in employment and income through governmental credit the monetary easing process and by the recovery of consumer the performance of retail sales suggests the continuity and likely strengthening of aggregate demand according to cni data without seasonal installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry averaged in the first five months of compared to and in the same period of and the installed capacity utilization according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the stood at in above that observed in reaching a new record high for the installed capacity utilization not only has grown but there are signs that the process has become more with many sectors operating close to their maximum data compiled by the fgv also show an upward trend for the utilization which reached in up from in june such increase economic activity despite the strong expansion of in the absorption of capital goods in the year through may grew in line with the significant increase in capital goods imports in as well as in capital goods production in the same the production of civil construction inputs increased the most recent data indicate despite quite investment has not been sufficient to avoid a significant elevation of the capacity utilization rates in this situation may reflect lags in the maturing of projects aimed at expanding the installed capacity or strengthening in economic in this the expansion of investment will be fundamental to avoid sharp mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust despite the strengthening of the confirming the evaluations based upon inflation reports and previous copom minutes that depict important structural changes in the brazilian foreign after reaching in a billion record a over the the trade balance continues to register strong positive in the year through the trade surplus reached a increase relative to the same period of exports rose to while imports increased to imports have been growing more rapidly than exports at the due not only to higher level of economic but also to the strengthening of the which points to a healthy adjustment process of the trade the copom assesses that the demand for brazilian exports has shown more intense than firstly even resulting in at the of the quantum similarly to the observed in previous the most pessimistic expectations will be frustrated again in with the trade balance keeping a very positive with regard to the international uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy stance in the us the prevailing opinion among international investors is that the start of an easing cycle this year seems to be postponed to the next meaning that the fed funds rate would be kept stable for many months interest rate increases in the us cannot be completely the possibility of economic deceleration in the us cannot be especially if the effects of the present difficulties in the real state sector over the financial institutions and the household consumption increase in intensity and on the other the strengthening of economic activity in europe and the continuity of robust expansion in the major asian countries have underpinned world growth at despite the economic deceleration in the the maintenance of growth rates at historically high levels in many regions of the world has led to inflationary especially over raw materials and food to which a significant number of central banks have answered by using monetary policy external demand for brazilian services and financial assets so remarkably benefited from the stage of the economic cycle and the global financial that demand also shows resilience to fluctuations in both economic activity and international market this external which the copom continues to consider has helped the brazilian economy to trail a growth cycle with price oil another external source of international rose since the last copom meeting and still presents high on one this behavior reflects structural shifts in global demand for energy on the other recurrent episodes of geopolitical according to this if the trend observed in the last weeks the main scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in might become less despite the eventual stability in domestic gasoline international oil prices swings inexorably affect the domestic for through productive such as the as well as through the impact over market inflation assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the june copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at the projection for electricity price adjustments in was modified to the projection for fixed telephone price adjustment was maintained at the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to down from of the june copom these according to the weights released by the represent of the total june the projection for regulated prices inflation in was also to this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the estimates a bps in the fourth quarter of reaching bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the june copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased to from this growth was mainly driven by the addition of the inflation occurred in may and ahead inflation expectations reached up from for inflation expectations remained at these developments continue to suggest the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased compared to the value considered at the june copom but remained below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the value considered at the june copom but remains below the central target for the on the other the projections for based on both the benchmark and the market reduced in relation to remaining below the monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data point to a strengthening of possibly more intense demand but still do not suggest high probability of important pressures over inflation in the in addition to investment imports growth has remarkably contributed to this complementing domestic production limiting potential inflationary effects of aggregate demand sustained despite uncertainties regarding the continuity of the strong growth recently observed in the international prospects of additional monetary tightening in important international and volatility increase in global the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external the combination of significant trade surpluses and increasing capital inflows suggests that the balance of payments will continue to perform the prospects for the inflation trajectory remain as in recent the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the the copom evaluates that the increase in global inflationary pressures still does not represent risks to domestic inflation but a heated demand could increase the of wholesale prices pressures to consumer price the copom also observes that the increase of ipca inflation expectations for and for the twelve months despite to levels below the targets established for and is a process that must be in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation discriminating between and persistent or generalized price analyzing the impacts over and inflation and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts as well as the effects of the economic activity on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in the first half of and expected for the next quarters of the the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have limited effects in and predominant impacts in in light of the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission the lower distance between the current selic rate and the equilibrium interest and the interest rate cuts implemented since september the copom members understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real will at some a more cautious monetary easing the copom evaluated since the last influences of domestic and external factors over the balance of risks for the expected inflation trajectory have continued to perform in opposite the external acting importantly to increase aggregate continues to influence inflation prospects in a predominantly benign on the other expansion of domestic demand may increase the risks to inflation dynamics in the some participants of the committee understood considering the extension of the easing process already the remaining uncertainties regarding the lagged impacts of the monetary the expected behavior of the other sustaining factors of such as income in a scenario of solid expansion of domestic demand for tradable and goods and and of economic activity deceleration in the reduction pace of the selic target rate to would contribute to extend the easing process over the majority of the committee argued that the contribution of the external sector for the consolidation of a benign outlook for especially by controlling the prices of tradable goods and by increasing in a heated demand reduces the risks present in the prospective scenario for such contribution is favoring the equilibrium between aggregate demand and domestic supply growth rates at a pace in line with monetary policy without compromising the convergence to the inflation targets four members of the committee understood that the risk balance to the evolution of future inflation would justify a reduction in the selic target given the reasons stated evaluating the prospects for the copom decided to reduce the selic target rate to without four votes were for the copom monetary policy while three votes were in favor of reducing the selic target by basis the copom will assess the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to define the next steps on its monetary policy under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price dynamics and its balance of despite the remaining uncertainties regarding the us the international scenario remains and benefits the external sector contribution for the maintenance of a benign inflationary on the other domestic demand expands the economic activity this expansion encompasses some sectors little exposed to external when the effects of important incentive such as the easing already are still not fully in such the monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on september for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october summary of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased in repeating the may this monthly variation reflected increases in the prices of clothing food and and declines in the prices of other especially transportation and personal the prices of milk and milk responded for of the monthly up from in again the drivers of the monthly market prices increased in up from in while regulated prices totaled down from in the same in the last twelve market prices increased and regulated among market the prices of goods increased by while the prices of tradable goods prices increased by the ipca increased in the first half of up from in the same period of accumulating growth in twelve months through up from in the same period of this rise in the first half of the year reflected the continuity of the upturn in food prices started in the last quarter of due mainly to the increase in international in this food prices grew in well below the but increased in the last quarter of in the first half of the prices of the food and beverages rose totaling in the last twelve months through ipca core inflation excluding household food and regulated reached in down from in while the trimmed means core reached down from in in the last twelve these inflation core measures totaled and in compared to and in the smoothed trimmed means core increased in the up from in totaling in the twelve months through up from in the increased in up from in totaling in the first half of and in twelve considering the main components of the the prices rose in up from in accumulating in the year and in twelve the increased up from in the same totaling in the first half and in twelve the incc rose in down from in reflecting deceleration in the prices of materials and services and labor this index accumulated increases of in the year through june and in the last twelve the increase in the variation of in june reflected the increase in food up from in the core of the index rose in up from in the previous accumulating in the year through june and in the last twelve the change in june on the one the reversion in the downward trend of agricultural which increased up from in may on the other the deceleration in industrial which totaled in down from in the main positive drivers for agricultural prices were in natura grained eggs and while the negative drivers were sugar orange and among industrial the upward pressures stemmed from the prices of fuel oil and and milk and milk whereas the downward pressures stemmed from moisturized ethylic sugar and pig the ipa presented in according to the processing stages of stability in the prices of raw deceleration in the prices of intermediate goods and increase in the prices of final in the first half of the the prices of raw materials declined after substantial increase in while the prices of final and goods slightly increased compared to the previous in the last twelve months through june these prices increased by and respectively economic activity considering seasonally adjusted gdp increased in the first quarter of compared to in the last quarter of compared to the same period of gdp increased by in the first quarter of and accumulated in four up from in the gdp evolution follows closely the performance of domestic considering seasonally adjusted gross fixed capital formation rose in the first quarter of while government consumption increased household and compared to the first quarter of fbcf expanded by household government and on the supply considering seasonally adjusted agriculture production declined in the first while the production in industry and services rose and compared to the same period of last in the first quarter of agriculture grew and indicators related to the second quarter of suggest the continuity of economic activity according to monthly retail sales increased in on a seasonally adjusted all activities with the exception of fuel and lubricants sales and parts and pieces which do not compose the general retail sales compared to may retail sales grew mainly driven by the increases in the sales of clothing and shoes and furniture and domestic appliances segments influenced by both the continuity of employment and income growth and better credit expanded retail which incorporate the activities of parts and pieces and civil construction increased in compared to the same period of the previous the sales of these activities and the positive performance of these segments should persist during as a result of incentive measures to the civil construction sector and better credit in the year through expanded retail sales increased by on a regional out of the brazilian states showed positive retail sales results in on seasonally adjusted the most significant expansions occurred in pernambuco sergipe rio grande do norte and roraima while the main reductions were in paraná tocantins and minas gerais in the year through retail sales rose in all with highlights to the performance of alagoas acre and maranhão the evolution of retail sales in the northern and northeastern regions partially reflects the impact of federal government social assistance programs in these são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the showed stability in database consultations for credit and a increase in consultations to the usecheque system in compared to june these indicators rose by and regarding investment civil construction inputs production expanded in while capital goods production rose seasonally the imports of capital goods declined seasonally adjusted this contraction does not represent a trend in view of the intense expansions in this evidenced by a growth in the first five months of and in the last twelve in the year through domestic production of capital goods increased by with significant elevations in the production of manufactured capital goods capital goods for mixed use and for production of capital goods for agriculture expanded by in the same while the negative trailing production reached in after in april and in confirming the recovery of the production in this bndes funding for and investment totaled billion in the first five months of above the amount disbursed in the same period of in the twelve months through billion was a expansion compared to the same period of last corroborating the recent acceleration of this investment industrial production grew in according to monthly industrial survey seasonally adjusted reaching a expansion in the quarter ended in on a moving average which attenuates punctual industrial activity reached a record high for the fourteenth consecutive in industrial production rose by compared to may and expanded by in the first five months of and in the last twelve considering seasonally adjusted manufacturing production expanded by while mining industry production declined by all use categories increased in the capital goods production increased by while consumer goods and intermediate goods production rose by and in the year through production of capital goods expanded by leading industrial followed by intermediate goods durable consumer goods and and goods disaggregated data of seasonally adjusted industrial activity showed that out of the sectors surveyed grew in with highlights to machines and and in order of the main negative drivers were chemical products and still considering the industrial according to cni seasonally adjusted by the hours worked in production expanded by while real industrial sales declined in in the year through these indicators increased by and compared to the same period of after seasonal installed capacity utilization reached in up from in considering observed utilization level reached above the may according to vehicles production reached thousand units in according to data seasonally adjusted by the vehicles production expanded by on a and compared to june considering the seasonally adjusted domestic sales increased by while exports decreased by compared to the first half of vehicles production increased by in while domestic sales increased by and exports decreased according to the same comparison production of agricultural machines grew and production of trucks grew mirroring increases in investment and recovery of the agricultural sector in the current according to the the june estimate for the grains harvest pointed to a increase in national production of grains should reach million due to good weather conditions and the production incentive driven by the increase in international agricultural commodities in the the main forecast production increases related to wheat cottonseed corn and soy while the main production decreases related to coffee and rice it still bears emphasizing the increase in land occupation for sugar cane in line with the growing interest in ethanol sugar cane plantations increased by in and the production should expand by surveys and expectations the survey showed stability in the consumer confidence index in the two icc components presented divergent with the current economic conditions index increasing in and the consumer expectation index declining by in the icea remained above the iec for the seventh consecutive compared to july the icc and iec declined by and while the icea increased by according to the fgv which encompasses two thousand homes in the seven main state capitals of the the icc increased in this result is due to the improvement in both the assessment of the present situation and in the ahead expectations compared to june the icc rose mainly because of the increase in the expectation still according to the the industry confidence index which encompasses six items of the manufacturing industry declined in the second consecutive after the record high observed in the ici rose relative to june expanding by in the first half of compared to the same period of this result is due to the positive assessments about the expected level of demand and the predictions of higher hiring in the level of installed capacity utilization reached in up from in june labor market according to the ministry of labor and thousand new formal jobs were created in in the first half of the thousand new jobs were a record high for the above the figure observed in the same period of these new hirings raised employment expansion by in the according to the same comparison in the last twelve expansion reached with highlights to the employment increases in civil construction and in commerce after seasonal employment expanded in with increases in all according to the ibge employment survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate remained unchanged at in may the unemployment rate stability reflected mainly the change in both employed population and economically active population the number of employers declined while the number of workers expanded by in the first five months of the average number of workers increased by relative to the same period of reflecting the expansion of investment and recovery in the agricultural the number of workers in the private sector increased by with a expansion in the number of formal workers and a decline in the number of informal highlighting a qualitative improvement in the labor according to the same real average earnings reached in a increase and a elevation compared to may real a result of the average earnings times the number of occupied grew in may and compared to the same month of last for a expansion in the year through according to cni seasonally adjusted by the the number of workers in industry increased in in the year through the number of workers in industry increased by while real

with individuals reached decreasing in the month and relative to the same month of net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in compared to in the same month of and to the average in external environment the global economic activity performance remains above the contradicting the cooling expectations of the beginning of the the deceleration of the us economy is largely offset by the annualized gdp growth of euro area japan and china in the first compared to the same period of the steady expansion in important economies also helped to offset the deceleration in the us global financial conditions remain favorable due to abundant which reflects the positive performance of stock the prices of emerging markets sovereign and the steady corporate this outlook is reinforced by the strong recovery in the global industrial by the robust employment by the end of the us inventories adjustment and by the optimistic forecasts for global some risks threaten this favorable the main risky factors are the new rises in the oil which are close to the august record the probability of adoption of strong restrictive measures to fight inflationary pressures and contain the specially in the maintenance of the adjustments in the us real state and the contamination of the specially in emerging as a result of the turmoils in the asian financial in the subprime us real state market and in the hedge foreign trade and international reserves in the first half of brazilian foreign trade continued to the trade surplus reached billion in the and billion in the last twelve while total external trade totaled billion and according to the same comparison exports reached billion in with a million daily record high a increase over june the expansion of shipped volumes and the prices increases drove the growth of brazilian exports in the three goods manufactured goods exports reached billion in the with a million daily record a increase over june primary products exports totaled and with respective increases of and according to the same comparison some important export products continued to present prices increases compared to june with highlights to orange juice raw soy oil poultry iron and steel leather and skin and metal laminates exports continued to show diversification in terms of particularly regarding manufactured items with low share in total and expansion of exports imports totaled billion in with a million daily record high a increase over the same month of all import categories raw materials capital goods consumer goods and fuel and lubricants according to the same comparison among the imports of raw materials and intermediate it is noticeable the acquisition of primary food transportation chemical and pharmaceutical agricultural products and mineral among the consumer the main import drivers were beverages and furniture and pharmaceutical the industrial office and scientific machines and equipment and parts and pieces drove capital goods in international reserves reached a billion increase in the billion in the year and billion compared to june money market and open market operations in the period between the june and july copom the interest rate yield curve shifted downwards for mainly driven by the favorable domestic economic outlook and by the perspective of a continuous monetary policy easing the june copom decision reduction of the selic the ongoing appreciation of the brl against the and the at the beginning of of current inflationary indices within the forecast intervals contributed to deepen the decline of the side of the yield uncertainties regarding the performance of the the financial losses in the us mortgage market and the expectation of monetary tightening in the main economies stimulated a migration movement of investments towards assets and contributed to an increase in the side of the yield between june and july three and and rates reduced and and rates increased by and the real interest rate measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectations decreased to on july down from on june on june the bcb conducted a reverse exchange rate swap aimed at anticipating the redemption of the swaps due july totaling in its open market the bcb carried between june and july weekly and sevenmonth long repo the average daily balance of these

auctions to buy totaling monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index changed in percentage points above the registered in june as a inflation in twelve months reached in june to in june market prices changed in twelve months until june and regulated until june among market the prices of tradable goods increased and the prices of the prices of food and beverages group cooled down at the changing in june and in twelve months until june on its the prices of services rose in twelve months until june in regulated inflation at the same time that inflation remains at high levels and the tradables inflation continues to the average of the underlying inflation calculated by the changed from in may to in as a on a trailing inflation reached above the one registered until june the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from in may to in the double weight core from to the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from to the trimmed means core from to the core by which excludes ten household food and fuels from to the diffusion which had reached in declined to in inflation measured by the general price index increased in june in and accumulates change of in the twelve months through june in the twelve months through june the main component of this the wholesale price index changed until june according to the breakdown by stage of there were increases in the prices of raw materials intermediate goods and final goods according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through june in the twelve months through june the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in the twelve months through june partially driven by the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in expanding by in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimate for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the increased in after expanding by in the grew in march and in the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation retreated in the services sector confidence index remained stable in after retreating in april and in the industrial businessmen measured by the industry confidence index increased in may and decreased in regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the indicates that grains production should grow by in relative to the the credit conditions indicators elaborated by the central bank based on quarterly surveys with institutions representing each credit market segment evidence for the third quarter of compared to the second prospect of moderation in the pace of concessions of new credit operations for the segment of big and maintenance in the case of small and medium regarding credit to the indicator suggests stability in the pace of concessions of credit lines directed to

have responded to the prospects of monetary policy change in the high unemployment rates in coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political are translated into investments decline and low the composite leading released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to signals growth prospects above trend in several advanced such as germany and the indicators of the purchasing managers index for june indicate continuing global particularly in the manufacturing regarding monetary accommodative stances have prevailed in the advanced in emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and in deflation is still the price of the brent oil barrel has slightly increased since the previous copom reaching levels close to it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have changed and the ones relative to metals have decreased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations increased in the twelve months through june assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price in was maintained at unchanged relative to the value considered at the may copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly unchanged relative to the value considered at the may copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions as well as readjustments and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this for bottled gas prices are projected to remain stable and the fixed telephone tariff is projected to decrease same values considered at the may copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in reduced to which incorporates the recent revogation of adjustments in the urban transportation fares down from considered at the may copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the may copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus trajectories for is considered as the fiscal according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law project since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca remained unchanged at for the median of the inflation projections increased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation did not change relative to the value considered at the may copom it remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast remained stable relative to the value considered at the may as a it stands above the inflation for in the baseline the inflation forecast increased relative to the figure considered at the may copom meeting and stood stable in the market both above the policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic in this despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity this year have with trend of intensification over the relevant horizon for the monetary in this there are localized improvements in advanced although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched to despite the resilience of domestic the committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international as well as greater volatility and dollar appreciation trend in the the copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses a more intense domestic activity pace in this and in the upcoming recent information indicate resumption of investments and continuity of household consumption the latter favored by public transfers and by the vigor in the labor which reflects in historically low unemployment rates and in wages in domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than gdp growth rates and tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy by the expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the program of public services among other the committee notes that the speed of materialization of these expected gains can be limited if the current decline registered in the business and consumer confidence is not promptly the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal despite recent initiatives point to an expansionist position of the public sector the committee notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth strengthens the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit in the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over despite the moderation the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent quarters call for a natural and expected correction in relative for the these movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is important to also highlight for the the mentioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the secondary effects arising from and that would tend to materialize over longer can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy the copom evaluates that the high inflation level and the dispersion of prices as recently contribute for inflation to show in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the deterioration in the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it is in this the committee understands that it is appropriate to continue the adjustment pace of the monetary conditions continuing the basic interest rate the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without the committee evaluates that this decision will contribute to set inflation into decline and ensure that this trend persists in the upcoming the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to be relatively especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the remaining effects of the policy actions implemented in for the these the programs of public services the permissions for the exploration of oil and the inventories at adjusted among create good prospects for investments and industrial the committee considers that recent initiatives point to an expansionist position of the public sector on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian shows that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of businesses and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the ones observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on august for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the ipca changed in compared to in according to the the monthly deceleration reflected the decrease

a gradual recovery of economic activity during the course of the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment the global outlook remains quite stronger global economic activity and its positive impact on commodity prices have so far mitigated the effects on the brazilian economy of revisions of economic policy in some large notably in the united there is also uncertainty regarding the outlook for the chinese returning to the domestic inflation presents favorable with signs of lower persistence in the inflationary the disinflation process is more widespread and includes ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary increasing confidence in its food price disinflation which constitutes a favorable supply inflation expectations collected by the focus survey for fell to around and expectations for and longer horizons remained anchored around the path of regulated which enters the conditional forecasts in the inflation scenarios produced by the assumes increases of in and in the market scenario among other the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the focus in this scenario assumes exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rates of per unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the january copom meeting the committee understands in the context of the ongoing monetary easing these projections with constant interest rates are not very from now the copom will disclose in the statements and minutes and at the end of the same under these the inflation forecast for retreated relative to the one reported in the january copom minutes to around the forecast for in this scenario remained around the inflation forecasts in the scenario in which the interest rate and exchange rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast horizon and are around for and for risks around baseline inflation scenario food price disinflation which constitutes a favorable supply shock and might produce secondround effects on inflation contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and of inflation itself in other economic the process of approval of fiscal reforms has been the next steps involve the consideration of reforms that are fundamental to the sustainability of the public such as the social security this process may be lengthy and involves the economic activity signals stabilization in the short but its recovery might be more gradual and delayed than currently the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic in light of available they all agreed that there are mixed which consistent with stabilization of its meetings only the conditional inflation forecasts under scenarios that it considers to be informative of its views on the conduct of monetary with the aim of maintaining a high level of the copom will continue to in the inflation conditional forecasts in the four scenarios that have been released since the inflation bank of brazil economy in the short the prospective assessment of the committee is that risks seem more balanced now than in the last months of the challenges for the resumption of economic activity and the committee expects the economic recovery during the course of to be regarding the global the committee members pointed out the continuation of uncertainties associated with possible changes in economic policy in the united states and also with the outlook for the chinese they believe that the brazilian economy nowadays shows greater capacity to absorb occasional negative developments in the global due to the progress in the disinflationary process and in the anchoring of all committee members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable way since the last copom in january to a large in line with the broad set of core inflation measures followed by the copom points to inflation at levels compatible with the target of for and inflation expectations remain the committee members reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation with inflation forecasts at the target for and marginally below the target for and in light of the high level of economic the baseline scenario prescribes frontloading the monetary easing regarding the extension of the the accumulated reduction in the selic rate at the end of the monetary easing the discussion focused on two different both relevant for its the first dimension pertains to the structural interest rate of the this rate depends on factors such as the productivity the perspectives for fiscal the quality of the business and contractual the efficiency of resource allocation through the financial and the quality of economic measurement of the structural interest rate involves a high level of and necessarily requires the committee judges that the change of economic policy by the with approval and implementation of fiscal reforms notably the social security reform besides others reforms and necessary adjustments in can reduce the structural interest rate of the brazilian in this the committee will continue to reassess its estimates of the structural interest rate of the economy over this dimension generates changes for monetary policy that are less frequent and more the second dimension refers to conjunctural the committee understands that its estimates of the extension of the ongoing monetary easing cycle depend not only on the structural interest rate trajectory envisaged for the but also on the evolution of economic on the other risk factors mentioned and on inflation forecasts and regarding the pace of monetary easing over the the committee understands for a given estimate of its a possible acceleration of the pace is equivalent to greater frontloading of the some members of the committee pointed out that the estimated extension may also be itself depending on the degree of frontloading of the all members of the copom agreed that the evolution of the economy since the january copom meeting was compatible with the reduction of the selic rate to percent the members of the committee discussed the next steps for monetary policy and expressed preference for keeping more leeway for future which will depend on the evolution of the baseline scenario and on the aforementioned risk they emphasized the fundamental condition that any future decision should be compatible with the maintenance of inflation projections at the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary and with anchored inflation they also on the one how monetary policy could contribute to the stabilization process and subsequent resumption of economic activity on the other the lagged effects that monetary policy could have on which is now forecast around the target both in focus survey and in the conditional projection in the market the committee members once again emphasized that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would allow the copom to focus on preventing effects of relative price adjustments that may occur over this applies to the favorable food supply the copom understands that the primary effects of this supply to which monetary policy should not should be estimated taking into account demand conditions in that monetary policy focus on possible effects of this which might contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and of inflation in other sectors of the all members of the committee emphasized that the approval and implementation of bank of brazil those of a fiscal and of adjustments in the brazilian economy are fundamental to the sustainability of disinflation and to the reduction of its structural interest with widespread benefits for the committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvement of the business these efforts are fundamental for the stabilization and resumption of the economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the current balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to percent per without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with a gradually increasing is compatible with the ongoing monetary easing the copom judges that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend on estimates of the structural interest rate of the brazilian which the committee will continue to reassess over the copom emphasizes that a possible acceleration of the pace of monetary easing will depend not only on the estimated extension of the but also on the evolution of economic on the other risk and on inflation forecasts and the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn

this the index has been slowing since december when it recorded inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in twelve months through reflecting an increase of in the industrial ipa and in the agricultural the breakdown according to the production phase shows that raw material prices accumulated while the prices of intermediate goods and final goods increased and following the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through june above the recorded until june according to the same comparison the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in june the producer price industry calculated by the which measures the industry price level excluding freights and registered deflation in compared to inflation of in april and in in twelve this index decreased to in from in as emphasized in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on an important coincident indicator of economic

june stood above that measured in june and below the average index of industrial activity showed expansion in with a increase in the industrial according to data seasonally adjusted by the after recording a decrease of in april and an increase of in as a industrial output reached a new record high in the threemonth moving average growth rate reached in the period from march to standing at a level below the growth measured in the period from february to industrial output increased in may and in the last twelve output increased in down from in continuing the process of growth since december month with the lowest output level during the the growth accumulated until may reached the industry real earnings have shown similar recovery dynamics was partially supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital intermediate goods and durable consumer goods increased in and whereas the production of and consumer goods remained in the twelve months through may intermediate goods output increased durable consumer goods output grew and and consumer goods output increased according to the same comparison capital goods industry activity growth is the highest among use recording an such performance evidences the investment a relevant factor for economic recovery in the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed decreased to in down from in compared to the level registered in june after reaching in march the observed data not only significantly reduced until june but reached a record low for the month since the start of the series in march the seasonally adjusted rate registered in a increase compared to measured by the number of employed workers in the six main metropolitan increased in after an expansion of in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that in june thousand jobs were created thousand in june with expansion of formal jobs in all the eight sectors of economic agriculture and services were the sectors that mostly contributed for the formal employment increase in according to real average earnings observed in june increased and as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in after recording an increase of in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand according to the retail monthly survey from expanded retail sales increased in after recording a growth in april and a decrease in according to the same comparison according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales showed increase of in after expanding in april and in the accumulated growth rate reached in up from observed in the two previous according to the last two comparison all ten sectors surveyed expanded in with in terms of to furniture and appliances equipment and materials for computer and communication and construction inputs in the next the retail trajectory will continue be benefited by governmental by the pace of growth of real by the consumer confidence and by credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal kept unchanged in between may and these values for may and june and lower than the levels observed in the same period of according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci retreated to in june level observed in march after recording in april and the nuci is higher at the construction inputs and intermediate goods at the the nuci in the construction inputs sector remained in the intermediate and consumer goods sectors there were increases and while in the capital goods the nuci decreased according to the confederation of national industry data seasonally adjusted by the the nuci in may reached up from in in installed capacity utilization rates have shown relative at high reflecting the recent expansion in economic whose effects have not totally been offset by the maturity of investment in this the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through while the production of construction inputs for civil construction increased as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance result in the last twelve months increased from billion in may to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months changed from billion in april to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding the needs for external the global economy recovery follows different speeds and asymmetrical inflation the evidences show activity moderation at the partially reflecting increased global the loss of dynamism in the us recovery the high oil as well as the effects of monetary tightening in important emerging in the compound leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for signaled world recovery continuity in but with despite still in the major on the other the purchasing managers index for the global which shows the industry and service sector activity after in reduced to in reaching the second lowest level since the start of global recovery the disaggregated pmi indicators evidence lower dynamism in the us and in the euro area contraction of economic activity in italy and the macroeconomic prospects for the euro area continue to exhibit strong because while some economies remain impacted by the insolvency risks and subject to strong fiscal the pace of expansion remains strong in other like regarding the last copom the market perception about the fiscal situation in the euro area in its implications on the regional financial system even after the release of stress tests showed significant and uncertainties related to us debt issues regarding monetary mature economies continued to show accommodative monetary despite the recent inflation inflation rate cores persist at moderate levels in the group euro area and for the emerging there are widespread inflationary pressures since the last copom there was continuity of monetary tightening in several in the bank of china raised reserve requirements once totaling nine increases in reserve requirements and five increases in the reference interest rates since october brent oil prices showed volatility and remains above this price level is consistent with a framework of apparent strengthening of global as well as of political instability in some countries of the middle east and north despite the decreasing intensity of it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten price which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the moderation of agricultural and metallic commodities after consecutive months of relevant in spot prices of iron traded in china fluctuated at levels similar to those valid at the beginning of the over the recent the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers has presented some but remains at high in recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to fx markets of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline accumulated in remained at considered in the june copom partial reversal of the increase occurred up to the adjustments for bottled gas for the same were kept unchanged at the projected adjustment for fixed telephone accumulated in reduced to down from considered in the june copom whereas the one for electricity rate increased to up from considered in the previous the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark increased to up from considered in the june this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total june the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark increased to up from considered in the june such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of billion of without in to parameters contained in the budget guidelines law a primary surplus of billion around of is considered for according to budget guidelines law project including the effect of the minimum wage increase projected for the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements changes announced in december since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased to from for the median of inflation expectations moved from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians for the ipca changed from and to e for the medians changed from and to and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation slightly increased relatively to the figure considered at the june copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also slightly increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projection remained stable in both the benchmark and the market and therefore remained above the midpoint target in both for the projection increased in the benchmark scenario and remained stable in the market remaining around the midpoint target in both in an alternative which considers the maintenance of exchange during the forecast at levels observed in the recent past and the interest rate path collected by projected inflation is above the target for and for and around the target for policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation targeting regime stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the reduction of both fx and inflationary risk among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has been increasing in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy the copom observes additional deterioration has occurred in international markets since the last with increase in volatility and risk mostly fueled by the extraordinary levels of liquidity and increasing uncertainties regarding the recovery of global in this the concerns about european sovereign and banking debts including central as well as those related to the possible slowdown of economic activity in prices of important commodities mainly agricultural at the same some stability in the us currency was in the prospects for brazilian economy external funding remain from another the price indices path shows clear dissemination of inflationary pressures in the main the copom evaluates although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is prospects for economic activity are this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stand at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the among other the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and substantial growth of the copom evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario has shown more favorable signs since the last in the last quarter of and in the first quarter of inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply evidences suggest that consumer prices have already incorporated the direct effects of these also relevant were the direct effects of the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments in the first quarter of the in specific shows signs of the committee considers that these effects shall still impact indirectly consumer prices among other through at the same it as risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth despite the signs that this mismatch tends to it highlights the narrow idleness margin of the production especially labor and analyzes in such a very important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and its negative impacts over inflation at the end of last year and at the start of this the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory in international markets were key to the prospective since april these prices have shown some the copom forecasts two distinct moments for inflation according to the main in this inflation accumulated in twelve months tends to remain at levels above those observed in the second in great is explained by the high inertia that stemmed from by the duration of the shocks that hit the economy at the end of last extending to the first quarter of this which reflect in the fact that the projections of inflation for the period between july and august point to average monthly inflation rates above those registered in the same period in from the fourth quarter the main scenario indicates a downward trend for the inflation accumulated in twelve moving toward the target the copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend in the public it bears highlighting since the beginning of this important decisions have been taken and which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is in the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit for which macroprudential and conventional monetary policy actions recently adopted still about this the committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies regarding credit in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which an increasing and uncertainty level and identifies risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation promptly converges to the midpoint since the last copom at the external evidences have shown additional moderation in the recovery process experienced by the economies in another have still revealed ambiguous influence over the behavior of domestic regarding the domestic macroprudential actions conventional monetary policy actions recently implemented will still have their effects incorporated to price a process that tends to intensify in this half of the although growing and elevated uncertainties that surround the global outlook at a minor the domestic do not allow the clear identification of the degree of persistence of recent inflationary the committee evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario shows more favorable in this assessing the prospective scenario and the balance of risks for the copom unanimously at the to increase the selic target to without domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although recent initiatives point to restraint in public sector expenditures in the first fiscal and credit incentives had been previously provided to the and shall still contribute for the activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness level of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial by the recent macroprudential actions by conventional monetary policy actions taken this these elements and the fiscal and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on august for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in down from in according to ibge in the first half of the the ipca reached compared to in the same period of last in the last twelve months through the index changed compared to in the growth in market prices declined from in may to in reflecting the slowdown both in the prices of from to and in the prices of from to in the same the segment of regulated prices changed by in down from in mainly driven by the reduction of in the price of the groups transportation and food and

previous among the industrial the main drivers for inflation deceleration were meat products and and the ipc changed in after increasing in accumulating in the year and in twelve in the food and transportation groups were the ones responsible for the decrease of the contributing and the incc changed in the compared to in as a consequence of the deceleration of some prices such as labor force in june from in and equipment and services from according to the same comparison the incc accumulated changes of in the year and of in twelve the decreased in compared to the increase in accumulating increases of in the year and of in the period ended in may in the previous the monthly result was influenced by the prices contraction in the sectors of food and coke and biofuel derivatives which

increased in months up to january in january and the prices of in january it should also be noted that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in months up to january in january and the prices of services rose in january in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in december to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in january the double weight core inflation changed from in december to in the core by which excludes ten food items and from to the trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to and the smoothed trimmed means ipca core from to on its the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household food changed from to the diffusion index stood at in january below the one recorded in january the general price index increased in reaching on a trailing basis in january the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in january with increase of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through january in january the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in january partially driven by pressures stemming from labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in december the increased seasonally decreased the composite purchasing index regarding brazil changed from in january to in surpassing the level of for the first time since september on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation decreased in reaching the lowest value of the series started in september the industry confidence index decreased in february while the services confidence index decreased in leading the index to the record low of the historical started in june regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the ibge in january indicates that grains production was expected to grow by in relative to the the industrial activity increased in after decreasing in according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the the industrial production accumulates in the last twelve according to the observed the industrial production decreased in the result was negative in the use categories and in out of the surveyed according to the same comparison according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry decreased between december and january according to the seasonally adjusted and it is lower than the one observed in january the pmi of the industrial on its decreased from in january to in among the use according to the january and seasonally adjusted data the production of capital goods recorded the most significant while the intermediate goods sector increased on the other durable consumer goods and semidurable and nondurable consumer goods recorded negative results in january regarding there was a decrease in production in the four capital goods durable consumer goods semidurable and consumer goods and intermediate goods according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate reached in the figure represents increases of compared to december and of compared to january data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were destroyed in the worst figure for january since in the set of available data indicates narrow idleness margin in the labor although point to an accommodation process at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume increased in compared to december on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction fell in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the retail sales growth rate was and the broad retail sales growth was with retraction in four out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the decreased in reaching the record low for the historical the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by the governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in january according to the seasonally adjusted among the industry use according to the seasonally adjusted the ones showing the highest nuci are construction material and intermediate goods followed by durable consumer goods consumer goods and capital goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through the trailing trade balance result reached billion in february this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with retreats of and on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators in the relevant horizon for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced economies and stand at relatively high levels in the emerging the price of the brent oil barrel increased since the previous copom meeting and reached levels close to it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have increased while the prices of metal commodities retreated on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations retreated in the twelve months through february of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the january copom among other this projection considers the assumption of increases of in the price of a consequence of the adjustment in the contribution for intervention on the economic domain and of the participation program contribution and social security financing of in the price of bottled of in fixed telephone and of in electricity in great part due to the passthrough of energetic development account contracted in to the the items for which there is more information available were projected for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for up from considered at the january the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at and of the gdp for and it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the january meeting and remains above the inflation for according to both the baseline and the market the inflation forecasts but remain above the target established by the policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in this the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the although in growth rates in important economies were lower than a more intense global activity trend prevails throughout the monetary policy relevant in this the prospects indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies a transition and of moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights evidence of volatility sources in the currency markets and moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and gdp have converged and that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the potential for the the activity expansion pace tends to intensify as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a moderate and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy regarding the supply the committee evaluates in the longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal the committee argues during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections will contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also highlights that this primary path will strengthen the perception of sustainability of the public sector it contributes to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in stimulating private investment in the medium and long specifically regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit important to highlight the fact after years of strong the credit market oriented to consumption has so over the last quarters it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by the recently implemented the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor which has cooled at the but considers that significant risk still related particularly to the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity with negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum this is not as significant as in the previous and the occurrence of real wage changes is more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary costs for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in great the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustments processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers since its last among other the intensification of the aforementioned relative adjustments in the economy has made the balance of risks to inflation less favorable this in this and as anticipated in previous these price adjustments cause inflation to rise in the short term and tend to remain high in while recognizing that these adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts over the committee reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from given the assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic rate by to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to due to factors such as income growth and credit on the other relatively favorable financial especially in the case of real estate the concession of public expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the for the the combined effects of these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets and this the dynamics of recovery of regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to over the next the convergence of inflation to the target established by the copom believes that the convergence scenario of inflation to in has for the the progress made in the fight against inflation like benign signals stemming from the medium and expectations indicators has not been sufficient at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on april for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june ipca after moving from in april to in reduced again to in as a inflation accumulated in the first half of reached above the level registered in the same period of the previous the rise in inflation in largely mirrors the behavior of market which increased by focusing on market both tradable goods and goods prices accelerated in the first half of the reaching and up and in the same period of on its regulated prices increasing by in the first half of the compared to in the same period of the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of reached until june and in twelve notwithstanding reducing at the in information available confirms deterioration of inflation dynamics at the start of on the other there was marked improvement at the the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed convergent behavior between may and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation decreased from in may to in and so did the double weight core inflation to and the core inflation by exclusion to in the year through the core inflation by exclusion increased by while smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation measures increased and these changes and above the rates prevailing in the same period in the trailing inflation on its reached in june and for the core inflation by smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation still standing above the midpoint of the inflation after six months above the june ipca diffusion index retreated to it bears highlighting the decrease at the margin of the in for both core measures and the diffusion the general price index inflation decreased from in may to in in the year through the inflation reached in the same period of under this comparison the acceleration of the reflected the behavior of its three the main the wholesale price index increased in in the same period of on its the consumer price index brazil increased in the same period in whereas the civil construction national index increased in the inflation under this comparison derived both from the behavior of agricultural and industrial while the industrial ipa increased in the same period of the elevation of wholesale agricultural prices reached in it should be emphasized that the dynamics of wholesale prices improved at the particularly the agricultural the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to foreign and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the index of economic activity of the bcb incorporates estimates for monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as products taxes it constitutes an important coincident indicator of after registering growth for sixteen consecutive the was stable in compared with a rise in the previous when it had slowed relative to the growth recorded in the evolution of the as well as other indicators of suggests that the economy may have entered a path more consistent with economic growth rates evaluated as sustainable in the long rather than those observed in the first quarter of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased in april and remained unchanged in on a the production increased in may compared to a increase in on a trailing after consecutive declines observed since february industrial production expanded for the second consecutive time and in april and on its on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output growth rate decreased in april to in the behavior of the industrial output and its components remained stable around the levels prevailing prior to the in the first months of this the buoyant pace in industrial activity has been influenced by the international the and as well as by domestic financial which have boosted domestic this process was also supported by the rebuilding of inventories and the anticipation of on its partially resulted from the prospects of fiscal stimulus despite the stability on a basis observed in the behavior of ibge industrial output series and its components returned levels observed in the process has been supported not only by traditional sources of but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the most important driver in may was capital goods which grew at the durable consumer goods and intermediate goods production remained increasing by in both on its consumer goods production decreased contributing to the decline in the consumer goods production in the even after the retreat recorded in considering the quarterly moving average all except for registered capital durable consumer and intermediate it bears highlighting that capital goods production expanded by in the year through the most remarkable expansion among the use evidencing the consistent recovery of the domestic after the the recovery in industrial production dynamism was initially led by the production of durable but it became widespread reflecting tax exemption in advanced process of as well as the easing in financial conditions and the income the future behavior of industrial production will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen which should continue to be sources of among other the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey increased from in april to lower than that observed in the same month of last according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached in above that observed in the previous after decreasing substantially after the the unemployment rate has shown some average real earnings decreased in after remaining stable in april on its increased by both in april and in with highlights for the civil construction as a real payroll expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that formal employment continues to in thousand jobs were created in june and million in registering the second best level for june and a record high for job creation in the first half for the historical which begun in the manufacturing services and civil construction registered the largest balances accumulated since the most dynamic sector for formal employment continues to be civil where employment expanded in the first five months of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales remained stable in may after decreasing by in april and increasing by in on a the indicator increased in the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of construction inputs fuels and lubricants and magazines and stationary expanded retail sales data have been evidencing mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable in response to the improvement in the access to income expansion and temporary sector incentives granted by the the retail sector indicates that the pace of domestic demand growth remains robust it continues to register positive although recent figures suggest some for the next it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by governmental by real payroll by credit expansion and by consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in standing near the levels registered prior to the according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci reached in may from in according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reached in june in the previous among the four use the nuci in consumer goods industry versus in the previous and in capital goods versus in the previous increased in on its the nuci for the intermediate goods industry decreased versus in the previous and for the construction inputs industry versus in the previous remained stable and stands at historically high record levels for the the reduced idle capacity is the result of economic activity not totally offset by maturity of investment data regarding the absorption of capital goods show recovery the absorption of capital goods increased in and in the year through the production of construction inputs recorded virtual stability at the margin for the second consecutive month in in according to observed it increased in accumulating growth in twelve in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have accommodated at high despite the recovery of as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance reached a billion surplus in billion lower than the obtained in the same period last this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade the behavior of remittances of profits and dividends contributed to elevate the trailing current account which reached billion in equivalent to of up from billion in on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of the global economy recovery continues to be led by emerging but there are several evidences that signal that this process may be less intense than previously in a scenario in which the dynamism in the economies europe and still in becomes less the us economy shows signs of but in an ambiguous way and at a slower pace than previously in consumer confidence remains at levels below those prevailing prior to the and although the labor market shows some unemployment remains at a high level and should retreat which is common in recent indicators suggest loss of strength in the us which could be attributed to effects of higher than expected anticipation of on its the japanese economy cannot overcome deflation and recovers at a slow led by recent data on consumption recorded negative rates for japan and also for the euro in the recovery in this besides being slow and uneven across the economies of the is very partly due to the fiscal consolidation and the difficulties experienced by the credit in the uncertainty regarding the sustainability and pace of economic expansion in mature economies mainly in the us and in a scenario where economic policy stimuli are replaced by contraction as the economies of the show high idleness for the production a process exacerbated by fiscal central banks maintain the accommodative monetary policy in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy continues unchanged in several but in those economies that were less impacted by the international which recovered more quickly and the adoption of more restrictive monetary policy stance since the last copom oil prices showed some both in spot and future despite the lower volatility in this the uncertainty concerning the quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in a context of asymmetric global economic on major uncertainties about the recovery of the european on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices might affect domestic prices both through production such as the and through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact on the evolution of food have presented some elevation since the previous copom with highlights for regarding industrial commodity aluminum and copper quotations while the nickel quotation remained relatively of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity prices were kept at and for the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was maintained at unchanged relative to the june according to the benchmark this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total june the projection for regulated prices inflation for was maintained at on the benchmark such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be reduced by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refers to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca decreased from to for the median of inflation expectations remained at the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the june copom but continues to be significantly above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also but stands significantly above the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection decreased relative to the figure considered at the june copom but remains above the inflation midpoint under the market the projection also and is positioned around the midpoint regarding the first half of the projection decreased in both positioned around the midpoint target under the benchmark whilst below the midpoint target under the market the dynamics of inflation expectations matches the view expressed in the last inflation through in spite of an increase in the projections between march and there were signals of reversal of this movement at the policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in international risk aversion and volatility have decreased since the last copom despite remaining at high and the perception of systemic risk cooled perhaps because these signs are still perceived with possibly as temporary liquidity remains besides the persistent concerns about the sovereign debt in european uncertainties about the sustainability of the us economy recovery and evidences of deceleration in china have even the prices of some commodities and brazilian assets increased and overall prospects for external funding for the brazilian economy remain the trajectory of price indices evidences the cooling of inflationary pressures in some relevant whereas prospects of deflation in other economies in this the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists a context of substantial volatility in international financial regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook the copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom considers important to once that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current and past inflation the prospective substantially deteriorated early this a dynamic that has reversed more clearly since the last in this it bears highlighting that there was significant decrease in the dispersion of headline inflation expectations for both and and for market prices inflation expectations the most sensitive and which more quickly responds to monetary policy prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain at a less intense rhythm than the observed at the start of the as evidenced by data on inventories and industrial among this assessment is supported by signs of a more moderate expansion of credit especially for by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high but with some accommodation at the and by the recent trajectory of inventories in some industrial the dynamism of domestic activity should continue to be among other by the remaining effects of fiscal by the policies of official banks at a magnitude lower than previously by the global which presents signs of in line with policy actions implemented in the first half of the since the last the retreat in inflation projections considered by the copom showed improvement in the prospective the copom considers that this process shall be intensified the signs of the persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand and supply expansion shall be because they tend to increase the risk for the inflationary in this monetary policy stance should be once this action contributes for the convergence between expansion paces of demand and international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the committee believes that the risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario are and are limited to the domestic such as those stemming from the expansion of domestic in the context of virtual exhaustion of the idleness margin in the use of production evidences of the market of factors tightening come from the real wages gains in some segments and higher pressures on production prices in the recent it is plausible to that factors that support these risks have decelerated at the it bears noticing that there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to where the effects of these developments on the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool in since the last the risks to the materialization of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation targets have partially due to the reversion of a substantial part of stimuli introduced during the international financial crisis of as well as due to the change in the monetary policy another contributing factor for in the same was the higher probability of deceleration in the already slow process of recovery of as a the influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation behavior started to show a in spite of favorable conditions for inflation dynamics in both domestic and international the prevailing opinion among the committee members was that monetary policy should boost the effects of these changes in this continue to act in order to avoid that uncertainties detected in shorter despite smaller than previously spread to longer under these evaluating the macroeconomic mainframe and the prospects for the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without considering the process of decreasing risks for the inflationary scenario unfolding since the last copom and which is due to the recent evolution of domestic and external the committee believes that the decision will contribute to intensify this under the the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the forwardlooking dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and should contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness margin of productive factors at historically low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial by those stemming from the monetary policy stance change and by those referring to the worsening of the global economy these elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets there was consensus among the committee members about the need to adapt the pace of adjustment of the basic interest rate to the developments in the prospective inflation as well as to the corresponding balance of at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on august for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the increased in down from in accumulating in the year and in twelve the wholesale price index increased by in down from in reflecting the larger impact of the reversal in industrial prices to than the increase in agricultural products prices to considering trailing the ipa rose in reflecting respective increases of and observed in the prices of industrial goods and agricultural the decelerated in down from in totaling in twelve the incc increased in down from in totaling in twelve the changed in down from in accumulating in the year and in twelve the reversal largely reflected the contributions observed in the groups food and beverage and transportation which registered monthly changes of and the diffusion index reached down from in the monthly change of the reflected the impact of the deceleration in regulated which increased down from and the reversal registered in market which totaled down from related to market the reversal reflected the retreat in the prices of tradable goods down from and goods down from market prices rose in last twelve months through reflecting the increases in the prices of tradable goods and nontradable goods whilst regulated prices grew the three core inflation measures

sales increased in six of the ten sectors with highlights for construction inputs and fuels and lubricants sales of clothing and shoes declined in for the quarter ended in retail sales rose compared to the quarter ended in retail sales grew in expanding by in the year and in the last twelve the performance reflected the expansion in all sectors addressed in the with highlights for the sales of equipment and office supplies construction inputs and furniture and appliances the cumulative sales in the first five months of the year and in the twelve months through may resulted from generalized increases in all with regarding the first comparison the increase in the sales of equipment and office supplies and furniture and appliances regarding the second comparison it is noteworthy the sales of vehicles and parts and pieces and equipment and office supplies the number of consultations to the central credit protection service and to the usecheque system registered changes of and in according to seasonally adjusted data from commercial association of sao paulo covering the state considering observed these indicators increased and in the first six months of the automobile sales by including light commercial trucks and declined in according to brazilian federation of automotive vehicles distribution seasonally adjusted by the the sales of automobiles decreased while those related to buses increased total sales decreased with highlights for the reduction of in the sales of in the first six months of the year and in the last twelve months through total sales increased by and capital goods imports decreased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the on a trailing the indicator rose in up from in may and in capital goods production increased in according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly industrial survey by with emphasis on the expansions of capital goods for nonserial industrial use and for mixed use in contrast to the decrease of observed in the production of capital goods for the electricity the production of capital goods increased compared to may highlighting the increases in the segments of capital goods for construction agricultural goods capital goods for mixed use and goods for serial industrial use the production of construction inputs increased in and in twelve the production of capital goods grew in the first five months of with highlights for the increase in the segment of goods for the construction disbursements granted by the bndes reached billion in the last twelve months through recording a increase over the same period of last in the first five months of the disbursements expanded by with emphasis on the infrastructure which represented of the total disbursements released in the followed by industry trade and services and agriculture industrial production remained stable in according to seasonally adjusted data from the by after declining in in addition to the performance of capital goods this movement reflects a increase in the production of intermediate goods and durable consumer and a decline in the production of and consumer with highlights for the decreases in the industries of food and textiles and for the expansions in the industries of electronic material and communication equipment and office machines and computer equipment industrial production increased with emphasis on the expansions in the production of capital goods intermediate goods and durable consumer goods in the last twelve months through general industry grew with highlights for the increase of in the production of durable consumer the production of capital goods increased according to the same comparison real earnings in the manufacturing industry increased in after a decline in according to data released by the seasonally adjusted by the hours worked and employment increased and in the same these indicators increased by and still according to the nuci reached in higher than the level observed in the same month of considering the seasonally adjusted the nuci decreased in while the average quarterly nuci grew in the quarter ended in compared to the quarter ended in vehicles production reached thousand units in according to data released by the seasonally adjusted by it bears noticing that the monthly decrease in a in the production of light in the first half of the year and in the last twelve months through the production of vehicles increased by and compared to the same periods last the monthly decrease of vehicles sales in june reflected the decrease in domestic market sales and the decrease in in the year and in the twelve months through domestic sales increased by and while exports expanded by and the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in june estimated the production of million tons of grains in representing an increase relative to higher than the forecast made in the projection incorporates the estimated expansions for the production of soybeans wheat and corn as opposed to the estimated retractions for rice and beans and expectations according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the fgv the consumer confidence index increased in seasonally reaching the second best result of the historical in the the current situation index increased which reached a record level for the third consecutive while the expectations index increased the icc increased reflecting increases of in the isa and in the the industry confidence index from fgv decreased in reaching considering seasonally adjusted reflecting decrease in the ie and a increase in the the ici increased reflecting increases of in the isa and in the the seasonally adjusted nuci reached in resulting in increases of relative to may and relative to market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in the first half of the most remarkable result for the period since the series began in january for the year through record highs in net generation of formal employment were registered for all segments of the reaching thousand jobs in the services thousand in the manufacturing thousand in civil thousand in the agricultural sector and thousand in according to seasonally adjusted employment increased in with highlights for the service which recorded the creation of thousand followed by the agricultural and the manufacturing thousand jobs were created in the last twelve months through of which thousand in the manufacturing according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in increasing and in seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate increased in the month and reached driven by the expansion in the economically active population and by the increase in according to the same average real earnings usually earned by workers fell by and increased in the payroll recorded and and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in equivalent to of increasing by in the in the year and in twelve credit operations increased by and according to the same comparison among the nonearmarked credit operations to individuals increased in the month and in the year and in twelve while credit operations to corporate increased and according to the same comparison earmarked credit operations increased in the in the year and in twelve highlighting the rises of and recorded in housing according to the same comparison the average interest rate on credit used as reference for interest declined in reaching the average annual rate on credit for individuals reached in decreasing by relative to the average rate on corporate credit totaled in increasing by relative to the average tenure on credit used as reference for interest increased in reaching up from days in this expansion mirrored the rises in the average tenure of credit for individuals and corporate days and which totaled and following the same delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety reduced in reaching delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate decreased reaching and with declined reaching net delinquency rate for retail measured by the after three monthly consecutive declined from in april to in environment the imf revised the global economy growth projection for from in april to in this change encompasses the estimates of gdp decline from to for the maintenance of growth in the euro and favorable revisions related to the economy performance in the japan and important emerging the risk of downturn in these rates turned to in an environment with uncertainties related to the fiscal crisis in in this recent indicators suggest relative deceleration in the growth paces in the us and while the consumer annualized quarterly change recorded negative rates in japan and in the euro and cooling in the it is important to notice the deceleration in the manufacturing industry in japan and in the euro as well as the negative change in the number of formal jobs in the us and the deceleration of retail sales and gross fixed capital formation in in this set of indicators translated into a retreat in the purchase management indices in the economies and in despite operating with financial markets have been steadier since the last copom especially regarding the performance of the main stock government securities yields of the main developed economies fell in the the annual change of the consumer price indices in in the us and in the euro in ratifying the deflationary the annual change in the index reached in compared to in october as the economies have recorded high idleness in the production factors and that fiscal constraints have the respective central banks have maintained accommodative monetary policy the number of central banks which decided to adopt more restrictive monetary measures have increased in the emerging economies of america and and in commodities such as canada and new where domestic demand has been trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in the first half of on a daily average this surplus decreased by as a result of increases of and in imports and external trade reached billion in the first growing by based both on the liquidity concept and on the cash international reserves reached billion in growing by billion and in the the two concepts were equal due to the full payment of borrowing operations in foreign currencies in in the year through the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic spot market and open market operations since the june copom the slope of the domestic yield curve has reduced throughout its the drivers of this movement regarding the domestic a more conservative reading of the copom the disclosure of current inflation indices and economic activity data and the expectation of a shorter monetary tightening regarding the foreign recent signals of cooling in the global economic activity were key drivers in the decline of long term between june and july and and rates increased by and the rate decreased by real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation expectations declined from on june to on july in its open market the bcb carried between june and july repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long term operations reached in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between thirteen and thirty working totaling a billion average daily balance of borrowing the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted daily tenure liquidity management the very including the liquidity management averaged a daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreement of the central bank increased from between april and june to between june and july considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was an increase in the repurchase agreements totaling with a increase in total stock from billion on june to billion on july the net redemption of securities by the national treasury and the federal government net expenditures were the main drivers of the liquidity expansion in the between june and july the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and ipca inflation increased in down from in as a inflation accumulated in the first half of reached decreasing relative to the level registered in the same period of the previous in the last twelve inflation decreased to in down from in may in december and in june the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the first six months of the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated prices considering market both prices of tradable goods and goods cooled on a trailing reaching and in down from and in december and in the same month of the previous according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of increased from in december to in june in june preliminary data for july point to consumer inflation below that observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed last year has been gradually overcome by a process that should continue to be led by the behavior of market while regulated price inflation should show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb decreased in the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices decreased from in may to in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures also recording and in and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core evidencing convergence for the midpoint of the it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced from in december to in june to in june the general price index inflation changed from in may to in on a trailing the inflation decreased from in may to in compared to in june the slowdown of the has basically reflected the behavior of its main the wholesale price index which decreased from in may to in according to the same comparison basis in june on its the consumer price increased up to june in june and the civil construction national index increased in june regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached in june while wholesale industrial prices reached in june as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after increasing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output increased by in may after expanding by in on a industrial output retreated by in with respective falls of and in mining and manufacturing the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output series and its at the according to data suggests that production reached its record low in and was followed by gradual industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international due to its effects both over exports and credit and over business and among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the it bears highlighting the increase in the production of durable consumer strongly influenced by the automotive regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased in and consumer goods production increased while the production of capital goods increased by at the in the dynamism of industrial led by production of the durable tax exemption measures and also some easing of credit the future behavior of industrial production which should not be uniform over will depend on these as well as on the gradual recovery of consumer and businessmen counterbalancing the deterioration of external labor market has continued to record ambiguous combining positive aspects with signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey changed from in april to in may in may according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached in up from in average real earnings increased by in in on its expanded by in according to the same comparison as a real payroll reached in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment decreased by in in and expanded by on a trailing according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment decreased by in the last twelve months and fell by in still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that the generation of formal employment has continued to record some despite below the seasonal in jobs were created to the positive result of in the manufacturing industry showed positive balance for the third consecutive the commerce sector continued the recovery trajectory initiated in with the positive result of on the other the civil construction sector and the services sector continued hiring workers this and the agricultural sector showed the greatest generating according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after decreasing by in on a the indicator increased by growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after recording in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of parts and and the negative key drivers were material and and supermarket and food in the cumulative growth was more significant in material and and and medical after consecutive falls in the last months of expanded retail sales data have evidenced mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of in response to sector incentives granted by the government and to some improvement in the access to vehicle credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in slightly above the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the and above the record low reached in the series seasonally adjusted by cni increased to in up from in considering the monthly series without seasonal in may the nuci was below the level registered in the same month of on its the monthly nuci without seasonal calculated by fundação getúlio vargas increased in june to up from in below the level observed in the same month of the reduction in the nuci according to the comparison is also observed in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and construction inputs the reduction on the nuci calculated by cni and according to the same comparison seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic and points to significant idle capacity in the manufacturing regarding the absorption of capital data indicate continuity of retraction and expansion at the the absorption of capital goods increased by in may a increase in according to seasonally adjusted and decreased in according to observed on its the production of construction inputs decreased by at the margin in after a increase in accumulating a fall in the in evidences suggest that demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry although the ones regarding the utilization rates have increased in the last as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance recovered at the under this comparison the trade surplus reached billion in decreased to billion in may and expanded to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts on the opposite the reduction in remittances of profits and dividends has contributed to limit the current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress reduction in international financial despite not in a monotonic the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the us and using a wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary have continued to moderate the perception of systemic in this there have been signs of reduction in risk but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to the decreasing trend of risk aversion and scarcity of capital as well as some concern about the fiscal situation in the continued to encourage the recovery of both from emerging and mature against the us regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary the current predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in with recovery only in the consensual projections point to a retraction of activity in the europe and japan which be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences that economic activity in could be with signs of resilience in consumption in the us and recovery of manufacturing activity in germany and on the other the problems in the international financial system might continue to be aggravated by the cyclical deterioration in the quality of focused on the us and which could reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions as a the risk of new intensification in the in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has decelerated considerably and for a longer inflationary pressures reduced the disinflation process seems to have gained momentum also in the emerging in spite of greater persistence of the inflationary in this monetary policies stances have become highly expansionist and focused on instruments in the mature while the expansionist stance in the emerging economies has been more at the same the authorities in the western europe and asia announced a series of important initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal which can contribute to a gradual economic important to that the estimates on the fiscal costs for macroeconomic stimulus and support packages to the financial sector are which has caused pressures over the risk assessment of several sovereign even in advanced the accumulation of signs showing that global economy could be close to an inflexion as well as the deterioration of public have resulted in the elevation of interest rate forward structure in advanced mature oil prices have shown high volatility since the last copom future markets quotations uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investments maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can affect domestic prices through productive such as the or through the transportation costs for as well as through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact in the evolution of food such as soybeans and recorded significant increases since the last copom of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following similarly to the june copom the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone for was kept unchanged at relative to the june copom while the expected adjustment for electricity prices increased to up from the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was reduced to down from considered at the june copom this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total june the projection for regulated prices inflation for reduced to against relative to the june copom such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and in unchanged relative to the june those figures do not take into account petrobras contribution to the public sector primary surplus and are adjusted by the possibility of reduction by up to in due to the implementation of the investment pilot program and in due to the ppi implementation and the growth acceleration program the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations office the ipca increased from to for inflation expectations also increased between the june and the july reaching up from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the june copom meeting and is close to the target established by the national monetary concil according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom meeting and is also close to the inflation midpoint inflation projection for based on the benchmark scenario increased relative to the figure considered in the june copom meeting and is below the inflation under the market inflation projection for but remains close to policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic the risk aversion increase and the constraint of liquidity conditions prevailing in international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of but show significant easing at the in since the last copom signs of a global risk aversion reduction continue to despite still subject to with impacts over both brazilian asset as well as over selected also influencing domestic financial it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary especially in mature but also in some emerging despite the increase in commodities prices since early the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to until predominantly the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may impose risks to the inflationary trajectory is the moderation of domestic demand pressures over the market of despite remaining subject to should contain the risk of of upward pressures stemming from wholesale prices apart from have shown deflation over the past few over consumer the committee that the materialization of such as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized over consumer still depends critically on economic inflation inflation expectations for and remain in line with the targets but have increased since the last copom meeting and continue to be closely it is worth noticing according to available the behavior of domestic demand should exert less pressure over the prices of such as in the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains on inflation control obtained in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of economic activity have continued to improve since the last copom in particular relative to though data on industrial production remain reflecting the accommodation of external demand and in light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial credit contribution to sustain domestic demand has diminished although signs of recovery in particular regarding credit loans to the severity of the international crisis influenced negatively consumers and businessmen but in this case there are also more consistent signs of under such the rhythm of economic activity resumption strongly depends on real payroll expansion and on the effect of governmental transfers that will occur in and it should also benefit from the gradual easing of financial in the most recent data on domestic economic activity seem to reinforce the mentioned in previous copom meetings that the contractionary effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which the monetary policy could become but be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have impacts concentrated in the final months of particularly in the copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism has caused an increase in the idleness margin of factors resulting in reduction of inflationary on the other the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario on the short from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior of services prices and regulated items since the beginning of as well as from a possible increase in commodities in the the risk stems from the cumulative and lagged from the financial conditions easing over the evolution of domestic taking into account the dynamics of consumption and in a context of recovery of production factors the balance of those influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates leads to the increase of risk for both private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income as a the copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation resumes the midpoint target in as established by the cmn and to keep it in line with the target path in and such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the increase of the idleness margin of the economy in to the industrial capacity utilization rates and labor market as well as to the behavior of expectations for relevant the prospects for the materialization of a benign inflation in which the ipca would resume evolution in line with the target have remained such evolution of the scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the as well as on inflation expectations set by independent under such in order to preserve the improvement of the prospective inflation under a macroeconomic scenario with significant the copom evaluates that monetary policy should maintain a cautious aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets the committee understands that the demand motivated by tightening of financial conditions and by the deterioration of although marginal improvements continue to be as well as by the global economic activity which could also be has created significant idleness margin of production which should not be rapidly eliminated in a basic scenario of gradual recovery of economic the copom also emphasizes that uncertainties around such basic scenario with positive and negative biases over the pace of economic activity such contemplated under the basic should contribute to restrain inflationary on the other the committee notices that the significant monetary policy implemented since january will have cumulative effects over the which will be evidenced with a time the committee understands that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the total adjustment made since whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over the copom also evaluates that a more cautious stance will contribute to mitigate the risk of abrupt reversals of monetary policy in the future to the consistent recovery of the economy over the next the copom also evaluates that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will require that the behavior of the financial system and the economy under a new level of interest rates be closely monitored over although some committee members think that there would be room to keep the basic interest rate unaltered already in this there was consensus that the balance of risks to the central prospective inflation path would still justify residual monetary in such taking into account the inflation prospects relative to targets the copom has unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to without taking into account the fact that monetary policy easing implemented since january has lagged and cumulative effects over the the committee at the present that this level of basic interest rates is consistent with a benign inflationary contributing to ensure the inflation convergence to targets path over the relevant time as well as to the recovery of economic under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a long period of domestic demand started to exert contractionist influence over economic despite the persistence of incentive such as income it bears highlighting that inflation expectations for and remain in line with targets it is also noteworthy that global economic deceleration has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial under such monetary policy could be significantly eased since january without jeopardizing the inflation convergence to targets on the other important monetary and fiscal stimuli were introduced in the economy over the last few and should contribute to the recovery of the and to the reduction of the idleness margin of production the stimuli effects should be closely monitored over time and are important in the context where future monetary policy which should ensure the materialization of the convergence to targets path over relevant will be at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on september for technical presentations and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom the ipca increased in down from in reaching in the first half of in the last twelve months through the ipca increased down from in the last twelve months through the key influence over the june figure stemmed from the beverages and food prices in up from in with a contribution to the mainly pasteurized whose individual contribution reached market prices decelerated to in down from in while regulated prices increased down from in the last twelve market prices reached down from in the last twelve months through while regulated prices increased relative to up to the previous the diffusion index reached up from in the various core inflation calculated with the use of ipca decelerated in both on and on trailing the core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in down from in reaching in the last twelve relative to in the previous the smoothed trimmed means core reached down from in the previous while on a trailing it increased in down from in the trimmed means core increased in down from in reaching in the last twelve compared to in the previous the totaled in down from in reaching in and in the last twelve the wholesale price index totaled in with a decrease in industrial prices and a increase in the prices of crop and livestock on a trailing the ipa decreased in with decreases of in industrial prices and in agricultural it bears highlighting the rapid reversal in the index which in october accumulated on a month trailing the decelerated once more in with a down from in reaching in and in the last twelve the incc increased in down from in reaching in and in the last twelve the core increased in the down from in reaching in and in the last twelve economic activity according to data seasonally adjusted by the monthly survey expanded retail which include construction supplies and vehicles and parts and increased in after decreasing by in april and increasing by in with those the average of the quarter ended in may expanded compared to the average of the quarter ended in sales increased in nine out of the ten segments with highlights for the increase in the sales of and parts and and and on a the only negative driver was material and the comparison between identical periods of and revealed expansion of in expanded retail sales in the month and of in in it bears emphasizing the increase on sales of personal and domestic and and perfumery the negative drivers were and home clothing and in the the following segments material and and perfumery magazines and and personal and domestic as negative it bears highlighting clothing and and and home whose sales according to the same comparison são paulo trade association data related to the city of são indicated a increase in database consultation for credit sales and also a increase in consultations to the usecheque system on a seasonally adjusted those indicators decreased and and on a basis they retreated and automobile sales by which take into account light commercial trucks and increased seasonally adjusted in according to fenabrave federation of auto vehicles total sales increased despite the falls of in the sales of buses and in the sales of expectations regarding the suspension of the ipi on industrialized reduction on expected for resulted in anticipation of which generated a record high on sales in a single in the year through the sales of auto vehicles increased with significant falls in the sales of trucks and buses according to the same comparison the sales of automobile and light commercial vehicles expanded by and regarding investment capital goods production and the production of construction typical inputs changed and in according to seasonally adjusted those indicators decreased and in and and in the year through capital goods imports retreated in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the may indicator decreased reaching a retreat in the year through compared to the same period of according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in seasonally the fifth consecutive monthly it bears emphasizing the durable consumer goods production reinforcing the recovery signs of the manufacturing all use categories and twenty out of twenty seven activities surveyed recorded increases in the monthly with highlights to the performance of the pharmaceutical industry office machinery and information technology equipment other transportation equipment electrical devices and machinery and basic metallurgy industrial production decreased in and driven by the decline in all use capital goods intermediate goods durable goods and and goods the cumulative industrial production through may declined compared to the twelve months through deepening the fall observed since a record low since the beginning of the in according to this comparison in the year through industrial production fell with special highlights for the fall in capital cni indicators showed smooth recovery of industrial activity in manufacturing industry real revenues increased after a fall in growing in the quarter ended in relative to the quarter ended in according to data seasonally adjusted by the the survey also indicated a increase in hours worked in production and a fall in according to the same comparison the installed capacity utilization remained unchanged at relative to according to the seasonally adjusted vehicles production reached thousand units in according to decreasing considering seasonally adjusted the production of vehicles increased in totaling a decrease in the first half of this in the last twelve months through the production of vehicles decreased by and the production of agricultural machinery decreased compared to the last twelve months through domestic sales of vehicles increased in june stimulated by the expectation that the tax benefit granted by related to the reduction of industrialized products tax would not be in the last twelve months through domestic sales of vehicles decreased by while exports decreased and in twelve months through compared to the twelve months through the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in june estimated the production of million tons in representing a decrease the new estimate represents an decrease relative to the three main declines of for the production of corn and of for soybean and a increase for the production of rice were also and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index increased in reflecting a increase in the current economic conditions index and a increase in the consumer expectations index the icc increased mainly due to the retractions of in the icea and to the expansion of in the according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the the icc increased in seasonally it represents the fourth consecutive monthly and the recent recovery was mainly favored by the greater optimism of consumers regarding the future of in both the assessment of current situation and expectations for the next months outperformed those for the current situation index increased and the expectations index reached seasonally a record high since september the icc declined recording figures much weaker than those registered last the consumer expectations national index measured by increased in compared to the index registered in the first among the index the one relative to the expectations for unemployment was the most important driver of the improvement observed in the expanding according to the same comparison the research shows that the fear related to unemployment decreased in the second quarter of with the index in the same level registered in september when the effects of the international economic crisis were not still so pronounced in the brazilian in relation to the expectations for the manufacturing the fgv manufacturing industry survey in for the sixth consecutive improvement in businessmen this result strengthens the consistent recovery of industry confidence index in the first half of the although it is still below the level recorded in the period immediately prior to the international financial the ici reached seasonally with increase of reflecting the increases of in the current situation index and of in the expectations index according to the same the installed capacity utilization has gradually reaching in against in june considering the seasonally adjusted the nuci increased to in above the level registered in market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in compared to thousand jobs created in totaling thousand jobs in the first half of and thousand new jobs in the last twelve months through among economic the agriculture and and the services sectors registered the highest net hires in june thousand and it is important to highlight that no sector of economic activity recorded net loss of seasonally adjusted data showed a increase in employment in the average of the first half of the year showed a increase in influenced by the increases of in the construction in the services sector and in the retail whereas in the manufacturing industry declined by according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in may decreasing and increasing the relative stability of the unemployment rate was a consequence of almost equivalent increases in the number of employed workers and of the economically active population which totaled thousand and thousand the increase in the unemployment rate was driven by the higher increase in the pea relative to the increase in the number of employed workers the survey pointed out that average real earnings of employed workers decreased at the margin for the fourth consecutive month but increased growing by in the year through and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in equivalent to of with a increase in the month and on a trailing credit operations increased in the month and in the last twelve among the which represent a share of in the total of the financial credit operations to individuals increased in the month and in the last twelve while credit operations to corporate decreased in the month and increased in the last twelve earmarked credit operations increased in the month and on a trailing with highlights to the monthly increase in housing loans and in bndes once the leasing operations in the individuals segment lost momentum at the with a reduction of growth on a trailing basis from in october to in considering the segmentation by economic it bears highlighting housing which expanded in the month and in the

on corporate credit decreased by relative to reaching the average tenure on credit used as reference for interest increased in one day in reaching down from days in the first increase since october the average tenure of corporate credit operations reached days in down from days in while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled days in up from the record high of days observed in delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety increased for the sixth consecutive month and reached in a increase relative to delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate and individuals reached and compared to and in net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in up from in the same month of environment the contraction of industrial production in the main developed countries slowed with indicators for japan and the euro zone returning to positive the final demand for goods and especially household continues to present signs of but doubts about the demand trajectory in the second semester in the short international trade should benefit from the current phase of inventories with stabilization or a possible conditioned to the expansion of final among the emerging it bears emphasizing which registered acceleration in economic growth for the first time since the first quarter of with gdp increasing by recent estimates of the international monetary fund for global gdp point to a contraction in and a growth in a reduction and a increase in relation to the april the behavior of consumer price indices in the main economies has been benefited by the low rates of installed capacity by the production price deflation and by the favorable basis effect in the prices of energy and in deflation continued to be present in consumer price indices in the japan and and was also present in the euro the behavior of international financial markets since the last meeting was more stable than the observed in the period between previous the vix index continued a declining while the stock markets indicators in the main economies alternated periods of in a first with periods of more recently the libor in continued to despite in lower the banking system still remains imposing severe restrictions to the last credit considering this the central banks from mature economies maintained the accommodative stance of their monetary while the central banks of emerging economies such as russia and turkey continued to deepen the cuts in their basic interest trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in a record high since december totaling billion in the first half of the in the exports reached and decreasing by and on a daily average total external trade decreased in according to the same comparison in the first half of the exports totaled lower than the one registered last on a daily average imports declined according to the same comparison the decline in exports in the semester reflected specially the sharp fall of manufactured goods on a daily average which was generalized among the main except for refined which increased according to the same comparison primary and products contracted and regarding brazilian all the use categories except for consumption which increased in the the purchases of fuels and lubricants and intermediate goods showed the biggest and reflecting the reduction of imported the impact of the international crisis over domestic industrial output and the decrease in the international prices of oil and byproducts in the based on the liquidity international which encompass the repurchase lines and borrowing operations in foreign reached billion in recording a billion increase in the under the cash international reserves totaled recording a billion increase according to the same comparison market and open market operations after the june copom the future interest rates reduced influenced by the copom decision and meeting by the prospective economic scenario analyses contained in the inflation and by the release of current inflation indices in line with market expectations and of employment and economic activity data indicating gradual recovery of domestic on the other the and longterm rates behaved differently in the same which resulted in an upward movement in the slope of the similar to the movement observed in the international between june and july and sixmonth and rates decreased by bps and the and rates increased by bps and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation decreased from on june to on july in its open market the bcb carried between june and july long fixed rate repo borrowing billion for a the average daily balance of the and sevenmonth operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of and working days on june of working days on june of working days on june of working days on july and of working days on july these operations drained from the market billion and the average daily balance of these borrowing operations reached the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of liquidity management operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily on june and the bcb carried out traditional fx swap auctions for rolling over the contracts maturing on july these operations totaled around of maturing through these from july the bcb ended all open positions of fx swap between april and june the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached being billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in april and october and in january combined with purchases of ltns maturing in july and october and in january and july and maturing in july totaling it also conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in september combined with the purchase of lfts maturing in september totaling the sales of settled in other national treasury securities maturing in and totaled the treasury also conducted purchase auctions of ltns and reaching billion and after recording in monthly inflation measured by the ipca reached in as a inflation through october reduced to down from in above inflation registered in the same period of market prices inflation through retreated to down from in and regulated prices reached up from according to the same comparison regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached while inflation related to goods increased services price monthly inflation decreased to in after growing by in august and in the accumulated inflation to down from in in the set of available information suggests a declining trend of inflation on a accumulated the underlying inflation measures calculated by the in showed trend similar to the observed in headline with slight decrease in the average of monthly changes and in the average of inflation through october the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in august to in september and in while the trimmed means core inflation increased from in august to in september and decreased to in the double weight core after registering in increased to in september and decreased to in at the same core inflation by which excludes ten items of food at home and totaled in up from in september and in while core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and of household food changed to in from in september and in the average change of these five core measures changed from in august to in september and in in the twelve months through the average change of the five core measures registered compared to in september and to in the general price index inflation registered in down from in in the twelve months through the change reached below the registered in october under this the index has been slowing down since december when it recorded inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in twelve months through reflecting an increase of in the industrial ipa and of in the agricultural the breakdown according to the production phase shows that raw material prices accumulated while the prices of intermediate goods and final goods increased and according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through october above the recorded in according to the same comparison the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased on its the manufacturing industry price index calculated by the which measures the industry price level excluding freights and registered in up from in in twelve the index inflation increased to in up from in the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the remained unchanged in after decreasing in august and

december decreased from in august to in the services confidence index from in the september decline rate signaling deceleration in the the level of the indicator was below the october and below the average level of indicators of credit built based on consultation carried out quarterly by the bcb with financial institutions representing every segment of the credit suggest mixed for large combined analysis of the indicators of demand and approval scenario suggests more restrictive in relation to credit for small and medium the indicators reveal a scenario moderately more restrictive in terms of and moderately stronger in terms of regarding credit to in contrast to that observed in the quarter that began in participants expect the percentage of approval of new lines for the fourth quarter to be moderately higher than in the previous consistent with the seasonal industrial activity fell in according to data seasonally adjusted by the after a decline of in august and an increase of in the fall in production in september was driven by the decrease of in the production of automotive according to the quarterly moving there was a decline of between july and after falling between june and production decreased in while in the last twelve it expanded by compared to registered in continuing the process of moderation in the growth of products surveyed decreased in production in compared to december month with the lowest output level during the the accumulated growth until september reached according to data from the national industry confederation earnings in the manufacturing industry recorded real growth in september while the number of worked hours worked decreased among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in september there were declines of in the production of capital in the production of durable consumer goods and in the production of and consumer while the production of intermediate goods remained at the same level as the previous in the twelve months through intermediate goods output increased durable consumer goods output grew and nondurable and consumer goods output increased according to the same comparison capital goods industry recorded the highest growth activity level among use expanding by the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed reached in compared to the level registered in october after reaching in after recording in march the observed data reduced significantly and reached a record low for since the start of the series in march the unemployment rate seasonally adjusted by the bcb remained virtually unchanged at in october in measured by the number of employed workers in the six main metropolitan increased in after expanding by in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that in october thousand jobs were created thousand in october with expansion of formal jobs in seven out of the eight sectors of economic services and trade were the sectors that mostly contributed for the formal employment increase in the according to real average earnings remained stable in october and accumulated growth in twelve as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in in evidences indicate that although the labor market remains there are signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey from expanded retail sales increased in after recording growth in august and in according to the same comparison according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales increased by in after decreases of in august and in the accumulated growth rate reached in down from in august and in according to this comparison all ten sectors surveyed showed expansion in the volume of with highlights for furniture and appliances equipment and supplies for computer and communication parts and pieces and construction inputs in the coming the retail trajectory will continue to be positively influenced by governmental by the growth pace of real by the consumer confidence level and by moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal registered in down from in capacity utilization stood and lower than the levels observed in november and october according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the the nuci decreased from in october to in the lowest level since november capacity utilization is higher in the sectors of construction inputs and intermediate goods in the sector of capital the nuci stood at while in the sector of consumer goods it stood at according to the confederation of national industry seasonally adjusted by the the nuci decreased from in august to in the rates of capacity utilization have been in the reduction in pace of production growth and the maturity of in the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through september until while the production of construction inputs increased until the trade balance surplus in the last twelve months increased from billion in september to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the last twelve months through the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months decreased from billion in september to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding largely the needs for external global economy faces a period of uncertainty above the with deterioration in activity risks to global financial stability are among other due to the exposure of international banks to sovereign debts of countries with fiscal especially in the euro it should be noted that the levels of risk aversion remain high for those measured by credit default swaps of banks in the euro zone are higher than those observed during the from another high persistent unemployment coupled with the need for fiscal as well as limited scope for monetary policy actions and political have contributed for the reduction of growth projections in advanced countries or even of their potential indicating wider and more volatile economic in the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for reinforced the signs of inflection in all main with less favorable prospects for this and the upcoming in specific the probability of recession disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for related to activity in industry and in the services in consistent with this there has also been continued reduction in growth projections for important emerging regarding monetary mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary stances in specific with new initiatives in the field of monetary regarding the core measures have persisted at moderate levels in the euro zone and with some marginal in emerging in the bias of monetary policy is the price of brent oil barrel has shown but remained above this price level is consistent with a framework of global demand coupled with high political instability in some producer countries and with lags in the process of production it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the continuity of the decline in the international prices of the ones related to agriculture and the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers accumulates a decrease of since the peak observed in february in the recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of growth and to volatility in fx of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price remained at the same value considered in the october for the projected adjustment in the gasoline price is the projected adjustment for bottled gas price remained at the same value considered in the october for the projected adjustment in the price of bottled gas is the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity accumulated in were changed to and from and considered in the october for the projected adjustments in the prices of fixed telephone and electricity are and the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark increased to up from considered in the october for the projected adjustments changed to down from considered in the october this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total october the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark is such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and the spread for the third quarter of is regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target around of without in a primary surplus of around of gdp is considered for and without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements changes announced in december the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the change in the ipca weighting which will take place in january since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased from to for the median of inflation expectations decreased from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians of expectations for the ipca changed from and to and for the medians changed from and to and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the october copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the inflation projections decreased in both the benchmark and the market and stand around the midpoint of the target in both for projected inflation also decreased and stands around the midpoint of the target in the benchmark scenario and in the market in the main scenario considered by the projected inflation stands around the midpoint of the target in this scenario was developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that identify in a broader manner the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the brazilian economy among the imports prices and the external volatility as a working it considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international it assumes that the current deterioration of the international scenario is more persistent than the one verified in but less without observance of extreme according to this mains domestic economic activity moderates and commodities prices in international markets and the exchange rate show some among other even with a moderate adjustment in the basic interest rate the inflation rate in the relevant horizon stands around the target in at a level below the one that would be observed if the above mentioned effect of the international crisis were not policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the inflation targeting regime maturing process stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the reduction of both fx and inflationary risk among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has been increasing in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the monetary policy traction increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years inflationary pressures are currently contained with more efficiency by monetary policy the copom considers since the last the risks to global financial stability have increased and thus contributed to the continuous process of deterioration of the international scenario already at that faced generalized and significant growth projections reductions for the main economic the committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain it also notes in these there seems to be limited scope for using monetary and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in for the main emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external through the trade the committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy can be materialized through many among the reduction of total trade the moderation in investment tighter credit conditions and the worsening consumer and businessmen the committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment add up to the those stemming from the moderation of domestic activity observed this which is already for in the retreat of growth projections for the brazilian economy this year and in the upcoming in other the ongoing moderation process of the economy a result of the policy actions implemented since the end of last year tends to be boosted by the weakness of the global the copom evaluates although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is prospects for economic activity are still this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that notwithstanding the accommodation at the stands at historically high the copom that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months peaked in the last and it begins to retreat in the current moving towards the targets the committee evaluates by this reversion of trend will contribute to improve the expectations of economic especially those of the price about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming the committee believes that this improved perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the economic activity both domestic and in this and in the upcoming the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the trend of the public ratio it bears highlighting since the beginning of this important decisions have been taken and which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderation in credit market still about the credit the committee considers opportune the adoption of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates at the start of the inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply as well as by the atypical concentration of regulated prices in decreasing these developments should also indirectly impact the dynamics of consumer through among other the copom evaluates as despite the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite signs of moderation in this it considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has retreated and is below the longterm that it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain price the committee also observes at the end of last year and at the start of this the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory were key to the prospective since april these prices have retreated in international in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level and evaluates that since the last the inflation prospective scenario has shown favorable the copom notes according to the main the inflation rate stands around the target in and identifies decreasing risks to the confirmation of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom unanimously decided to decrease the selic target to without domestic demand is still especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit this scenario tends to prevail in the upcoming when the domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of the monetary policy actions recently implemented in are lagged and on the other recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the substantial deterioration in the international these elements and the quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom believes that by promptly mitigating the effects stemming from a more restrictive global moderate adjustments in the level of the basic rate are consistent with the scenario of inflation convergence to the target in at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on january for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom

decelerated in the euro zone and in in the the annualized growth rate in the third quarter was stimulated by household which was also influenced by the reduction in the savings in the labor and housing credit conditions and consumer confidence remain the need for consolidation and the volatility in financial markets continue as downward drivers for the economic growth in the in part of the growth reflected the reversion of the effects stemming from the natural disasters occurred in in the euro where the worsening of the sovereign debt crisis spreads towards the most important countries in the economic activity decelerated to in the third confidence indicators in the region are at low and the preliminary purchasing managers index built for the region reached in for the third consecutive contraction in the private sector despite continues with significant pace of economic the gdp growth reduced to in the third down from the previous retail sales and industrial production in monthly real growth rates of and and and the difficulties of policy coordination and the lack of consistent rescue mechanisms for the euro zone countries favored the intensification of the movement of risk aversion in financial markets since the end of leading to increased cost of debt financing in the countries of the in this scenario of flight to the dollar appreciated against the there was a reduction of the us bond and the risk premium measured by sovereign credit default swaps of spain and france reached record in stock the stock exchanges resumed trajectory of and the chicago board options exchange volatility which measures the implied volatility of remained signaling strong perception of commodities international prices continued to show strong volatility since the last monetary policy committee but with a declining a further increase in risk as a result of the worsening of the fiscal crisis in regarding agricultural satisfactory results of the harvest in important production regions of the northern hemisphere and positive outlook for the grain crop in south america also contributed to the decline in the international inflation scenario was more benign since the last monetary policy committee particularly in major developed economies and the consumer price index reported in october a decrease in their annual variations in the uk and to and compared to and in while remained at in the euro among emerging the annual change in cpi showed a downward trend in indonesia and but maintained upward trend in south turkey and in the last meetings of their monetary policy central banks in the japan and england maintained their basic interest on the other in the euro the refinancing rate was reduced by basis points to on november besides the european central bank the reserve bank of australia and the bank of indonesia in their official by basis points to and by basis points to in the reserve bank of concerned about the escalation of inflation to in raised the repo rate by basis points to in trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in exports reached billion and in the the trade surplus totaled above the registered in

increasing billion compared to to external operations that increased the total outstanding by compared to december the reserves increased in there were no monetary interventions in the domestic spot market and open market operations since the last copom in the domestic interest rate yield curve decreased in all its this movement was driven mainly by the substantial deterioration of the external due to the worsening of the sovereign debts of countries in the euro zone and the potential consequences for the global regarding the domestic the release of data that indicate deceleration in economic growth and less intense growth of formal the improvement of the prospective scenario for inflation and the expectation of extending the monetary easing cycle also contributed to the fall in interest between october and november the and interest rates fell by and the rates for maturities of two and three years declined and the real interest as measured by the ratio between the nominal rate of one year and expected inflation for the next twelve decreased from on october to on november the fall in nominal on october the central bank carried out traditional exchange rate swap auction directed to the rollover of the contracts due on november this operation totaled the equivalent to million in notional in its open market the bcb carried out between october and november repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations decreased to in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between twelve and working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through very the average daily balance of these operations was billion in the the average daily balance of the total outstanding of repurchase agreements of the central bank decreased from between august and october to between october and november considering the operations for the most recent the total outstanding of repurchase agreements decreased from on october to on november the main factors that contributed to the contraction of liquidity in the period were the net revenues of the union and the net issuance of treasury between october and november the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in issuance of reached for securities maturing in and update of economic outlook and baseline the set of economic activity indicators shows consistent recovery of the brazilian economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook has been as economies grow this has so far contributed to support risk appetite towards emerging baseline inflation scenario has evolved in a more benign fashion than expected since the turn of the inflation developments remain with various measures of underlying inflation running at low this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary expectations for collected by the focus survey are around expectations for and are around percent and path of administered prices underlying the conditional inflation scenarios produced by the copom assumes variations of percent for and percent for scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rate at percent per year at the end of and percent at the end of these the inflation projections declined to percent for and to percent for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the february copom meeting risks around baseline inflation the baseline inflation scenario involves risks in both on the one hand the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available one member mentioned signs of a slight at the in the process of economic but other members considered that these oscillations are natural at the present stage of the all members agreed that the recovery shows in this committee members believe that as economic activity inflation tends to gradually return to they reaffirmed the view as a result of current levels of slack in the marginal revisions in the intensity of recovery would not lead to material revisions in the expected path for regarding the global the committee reiterated that the evolution of the global economy has been with widespread economic signs are already emerging that labor market conditions have started to increase wages in some central there are also prospects that inflation rates in these economies will return to levels closer to their this reinforces the scenario of continuation of the monetary policy normalization process in central which should take place gradually in the baseline but the prospective trajectory of price and wage inflation may make this process more volatile and induce some tightening of global financial there was acknowledgment of the increased risks to bank of copom expansion of international due to protectionist with possible impacts on global growth and on the volatility of financial in this committee members once again highlighted the brazilian capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in the global given its robust balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospects of economic the copom pondered once more the risk for the brazilian economy of a reversal in this benign global in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout the current and subsequent all members agreed that inflation has evolved more favorably than expected since the turn of the committee reaffirmed the belief in the case of occasional relative price adjustments resulting from supply with anchored inflation monetary policy should only address the effects of these the committee emphasizes that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be that is to monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply the copom discussed the level and the path of several measures of underlying inflation including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy were considered to be running at low the committee also discussed the extent to which their trajectories are compatible with convergence of inflation towards the target over the relevant horizon for monetary on the one the persistence of underlying inflation measures at low levels poses downward risks for the prospective inflation on the other both the expectation that the recovery of economic activity will contribute to elevate underlying inflation towards target over the relevant horizon and the risks associated of a setback in the global in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the the copom understands that monetary policy has to balance these two given the uncertainty associated with the lags in the impacts of monetary easing on the path of this includes reacting to ensure that inflation converges to target at a proper pace at the same guaranteeing that the achievement of a low inflation environment even in the event of adverse the copom reaffirms that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks in both the committee expressed the view that economic conditions with anchored inflation measures of underlying inflation running at low inflation projections below target for and around target for and a high level of economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary with interest rates below the structural although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of committee members expressed the view that current real interest rates provide stimulus to the copom understands that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over copom members agreed since its february meeting the evolution of the the baseline scenario and the balance of risks was compatible with the reduction of the selic rate to percent per the committee then discussed the next steps in conducting monetary there was a consensus that the evolution of the the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its february meeting made over the need for an adjustment of monetary policy in relation to the path that had been signaled at the previous meeting as most part of this adjustment could be implemented by reducing the selic rate to percent this had already been reflected in projections and in the term structure of interest the members of the copom concluded in favor of the need to make monetary policy a little more this conclusion derived from two the copom judged that the dynamics of various underlying inflation measures signaled a greater risk of delayed convergence of inflation toward the in this an additional monetary stimulus would mitigate this the committee considered the fact even with a selic rate path that already included a reduction to percent the outlook for inflation taking into account projections and assessment of a wide array of information showed a decline over the relevant mainly for the copom has therefore decided to for the next an additional moderate monetary easing as appropriate from the current in view of the principle guiding its conduct of monetary of clarifying conditionalities that it deems the committee also decided to communicate that this vision for the next meeting might change in favor of the interruption of the monetary easing if risk mitigation proves bank of copom committee then proceeded to discuss the steps following the next bearing in mind the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary policy at that which will already be focused mainly on considering the baseline the balance of risks and the lags and uncertainties associated with the transmission of monetary the committee concluded by it should be appropriate to interrupt the process of monetary given the risks facing the economy and the uncertainty about the lags in the transmission of monetary the committee believes that it may require some time to evaluate the evolution of the economy and its reaction to the monetary stimulus already in given the relevant horizon at that the debate then proceeded on how to communicate this vision to meetings beyond the some members expressed a preference for indicating that it should be necessary to wait for a few copom until sufficient information is gathered to assess the behavior of the other members argued that they did not see a need to commit to such in the the committee decided to communicate for meetings other than the absent relevant additional changes to the baseline scenario and balance of the copom deems appropriate to interrupt the monetary easing with the aim of evaluating next in light of the relevant horizon for monetary policy at that the committee reaffirmed its preference for communicating conditionalities on the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality that guides its this contributes to increase transparency and improve copom in this the members reaffirmed that the next steps in the conduct of the monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle and on inflation projections and committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the brazilian economy are fundamental for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary policy and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the economy and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by percentage to percent per the committee judges that this decision is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with a gradually increasing committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over evolution of the baseline scenario made it appropriate to reduce the selic rate by percentage point at this copom regarding the next at this time the copom views an additional moderate monetary easing as the committee judges that this additional stimulus mitigates the risk of delayed convergence of inflation toward the this view regarding the next copom meeting might change in favor of the interruption of the monetary easing if risk mitigation proves beyond the next absent relevant additional changes to the baseline scenario and balance of the copom deems appropriate to interrupt the monetary easing with the aim of evaluating next in light of the relevant horizon for monetary policy at that the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation projections and the following committee members voted for this ilan goldfajn carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes costa de ribeiro paulo neves de reinaldo le sidnei marques and tiago couto update of economic outlook and baseline recent data on economic activity came in below the brazilian economy remains on a gradual recovery the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook remains on the one the risks associated with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies have receded since the previous copom on the other the risks associated with a slowdown in global as a result of several are more various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for and for this scenario among other a path for the selic rate that ends at and increases to over the course of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at and at in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for in the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the february copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies the committee judges that the balance of risks for inflation is discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available they confirmed the slowdown in activity during the last quarter of which ran below the expected they also assessed available projections for economic growth in including those from the focus the projections have declined since the release of the national to a large the lower level for gdp at the end of that the part of the revisions for growth also seems to reflect preliminary indicators available for the first months of the current these revisions the projections for gdp growth at the margin that from the first or second quarters relative to previous quarters have not changed these dynamics are consistent with the baseline scenario of recovery of the brazilian economy at a gradual copom members considered that the brazilian economy has experienced several shocks throughout including the temporary halt in the transportation sector in the adverse global environment for emerging economies from the second quarter and high uncertainty about the direction of brazilian economic policies to be pursued in the coming these factors impacted the economy and led to a relevant tightening of financial whose value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom economic activity persist even after their direct effects committee members judge that these shocks must have significantly reduced the growth that the brazilian economy would have experienced in their they also point out that an acceleration in the pace of economic recovery to more robust levels will depend on a reduction of uncertainties regarding the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments that the brazilian economy they stress the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and the development of the brazilian regarding the global the committee members considered that it remains challenging for emerging the committee discussed the contrast of different scenarios for the evolution or the us the first scenario comprises a significant deceleration of economic the second scenario assumes continuity of the strength exhibited in recent these two scenarios have opposite implications for the conduct of monetary policy by the which signaled that it intends to wait for the resolution of this uncertainty over in copom members recognized given the slowdown in activity in some relevant the risks associated with a weakening in the global economy have europe is showing signs of a significant economic slowdown and uncertainty drivers can contribute to even slower global in this the copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of anchored inflation and prospects of economic committee members discussed recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying they assessed that those measures are at appropriate or comfortable and that inflation projections indicate convergence of inflation to target over the course of and the committee foresees an increase in inflation during the next which should lead inflation to reach a peak around april or inflation should recede and close the year at the levels projected in paragraphs and the copom members that the consolidation of this favorable scenario in the medium and long terms depends on the pace of necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian which are essential for the sustainability of the environment with anchored inflations the committee members discussed the evolution of the factors highlighted in their balance of risks around the baseline inflation since its previous although with different assessments and weights to the evolution of each risk in all agreed that the balance of risks is copom members assessed that and perseverance in conducting monetary policy in the face of uncertainties regarding economic is the best way of keeping inflation on a trajectory towards the the copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at appropriate or comfortable inflation projected to move toward targets for and and high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of the committee members expressed the view that the current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe stimulative monetary all members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on the outlook particularly inflation and the level of slack in the balance of risks and inflation the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its february meeting they unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to increase transparency and enhance the committee deems important to observe how the brazilian economy will behave over with lower uncertainty and without the effects of the various shocks that hit the economy last the committee judges that this assessment takes time and should not be completed in the short the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms central do copom those of fiscal and adjustments in the brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary and for the

been instrumental in pursuing its primary objective of keeping the inflation path towards the the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carlos viana de de assis manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro paulo neves de and tiago couto ipca inflation accelerated in may and june to and up from in as a inflation reached in the first half of the highest change observed since may up from in the same period of trailing inflation continued to in after reaching in it totaled in may and in june to in the same month of under this comparison the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which increased more rapidly than regulated in market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through compared to and in the twelve months through june despite the brl the prices of tradable goods reaching to in june according to the same comparison regarding the prices of greatly pressured by the behavior of perishable food and services trailing inflation was even higher evidencing the influence of domestic factors over inflationary for the price of services increased in june up from in december and in june according to the same comparison preliminary data for july point to the continuity of consumer inflation at elevated despite some moderation at the in since the end of inflation has diverged from the targets the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb have evolved in line with the headline the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated the smoothed trimmed means core inflation and the trimmed means core inflation measures increased from and in to and in and to and in similarly to headline the three core inflation measures remarkably accelerated in the first half of the compared to the same period of with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core on a trailing the three core inflation measures continued to follow the behavior of headline core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices continued to increase to in up from in may and in smoothed trimmed means core inflation showed similar behavior in up from in may and in whereas the trimmed means core inflation increased to in up from in and in as a all core inflation measures stand above the central value for the inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of diffusion indices suggests increased dissemination of the inflationary confirming the analysis present in previous copom the general price index inflation increased to in up from in may and in on a trailing inflation accelerated to in up from in in april and in june in the twelve months through the increase reflected the behavior of the three main the consumer price increased in june while the wholesale price index totaled in june according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in june regarding the agricultural inflation reached in the twelve months through june it also bears highlighting the continuity of upward pressures over wholesale industrial a process that began in the second half of and does not signal in the first half of wholesale price inflation increased up from in the same period of in in the last twelve wholesale industrial price inflation increased in up from in december as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation after the last copom the ibge released data for first quarter data showed robust growth rates in the first quarter of both for accumulated results in the year up from in the fourth quarter of and for results as against in the previous on the aggregate demand gross fixed capital formation continues to post strong growing by in the first quarter of the expansion of household which tends to be less volatile than investment along the retreated from in the last quarter of to still robust in the first quarter of the under the same comparison on the aggregate supply it bears emphasizing the increase in industrial led by manufacturing industry and by civil construction industry in the first quarter of the on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after growing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the expansion observed in industrial output retreated in partially reflecting the unusual holiday schedule observed this it bears noticing that general industrial output grew in the year through with respective increases of and in manufacturing and in mining on a industrial output expanded by in may with less two working with changes of and in manufacturing industry and in the data already released for the last months in to the continuity of the industrial production expansion despite at a more moderate pace and subject to possible limits to supply among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital goods production retreated in after increasing by in regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased durable consumer goods production retreated by for and and consumer goods production expanded by in the capital goods production leads the with a followed by the elevation in durable consumer goods despite the strong fall observed in there are no sufficient evidences of inflection in the expansion process of capital goods which has been mainly driven by the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of economic on its the dynamism of durable consumer goods production credit which remain more favorable than historical the existence of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production factors suggests that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion can be greatly associated to productive capacity added up to imports penetration labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey decreased to in down from in as a the average unemployment rate in the first five months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate decreased to in may down from in a record low for the month since the start of the historical series in in real average earnings fell and increased in the first five months of real average earnings increased while employment grew as a real payrolls expanded by growth in may in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in may to in april and in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment this with the creation of thousand jobs in may and thousand jobs in june results corresponds to a increase over the previous record high for the registered in thousand and a increase over the record high in the series observed in april thousand in the first half of the employment reached a record high of thousand an evidence of the labor market formal employment grew by in seasonally and observed data point to a expansion in formal employment in the last twelve the agricultural sector presented the highest hiring rate in with the creation of thousand new a record high for the series in the followed by the services sector thousand new also a record high for the the manufacturing industry recorded thousand new up from thousand in june whereas the retail sector recorded thousand new jobs thousand in june and the civil construction recorded thousand new jobs thousand in june besides the process of formalization in the labor these data evidence the strong dynamism in labor force in formal employment grew by in in line with the positive developments in the labor market and with credit retail sales continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and signs of cooling cannot be according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales grew by in after increasing in april and in and growing by and in the first five months of expanded retail sales moving average increased in representing the consecutive monthly according to data seasonally on a it bears emphasizing the expansion in computing and communication material and and personal and domestic in accumulated growth was more significant in computing and communication material and parts and and personal and domestic despite the rise in the prices of and supermarket food beverages and tobacco showed a significant growth in the steady growth of retail sales reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit for the next the continuity of the current expansion cycle of retail sales is and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high sector for relative to automobile sales in corroborate this the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in may down from in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by since march the nuci in the manufacturing industry has showed stability in a level slightly below the record high observed for the series in november without the seasonal the nuci stood almost at the same level registered in may as a the average rate in the first five months of was above the level observed in the same period of the monthly nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas reached in according to the observed standing significantly above the level registered in the same month of the elevation in the nuci in june is also observed for the production of civil construction inputs sector for the consumer goods sector and for the capital goods sector for the intermediate goods the nuci stood below the level observed in june the maintenance of installed capacity utilization rates at historically high levels occurs in several sectors despite investments accumulated in the last twelve in may according to seasonally adjusted the absorption of capital goods decreased influenced by the reduction in the capital goods despite the volume growth of capital goods imports in favored by the end of strike on brazilian tax in the same the production of civil construction inputs increased considering that the absorption of capital goods in presented a robust result expressed in the significant growth of capital goods imports in and of capital goods production it is premature to assume the last monthly data for the absorption of capital goods as a trend in the same the production of inputs for civil construction industry increased by in recent data indicate although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization the maturation of investment projects has not been until to significantly limit existing mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present deceleration at the a trend that was already and is in line with assessments present in inflation reports and previous copom in the last twelve months through june the trade surplus reached billion below june exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and in the last twelve compared to the same period ended in june as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust economic activity in the notwithstanding the elevated price levels of several commodities included in the brazilian export the decrease in trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through may equivalent to of foreign direct investment reached billion in the same equivalent to of regarding the external the world economy still shows divergent on the one even though economic in has been stronger than anticipated in the majority of countries in the first which in some cases resulted in upward revisions in growth projections for the the more recent data shows some signs of especially in mature this trend should continue during the second on the other the increase in the prices of raw and the pressures of heated demand over the capacity of supply which are particularly evident in emerging have resulted in strong acceleration of current significantly in several inflationary in a severe financial crisis in the at a lower in is added up to this difficult macroeconomic in this although the existence of strong inflationary pressures is cause of concern for the majority of monetary policy aiming to control have occurred situation that tends to the us economy seems to have entered a process of economic stagnation since the last quarter of and still suffers the impact of the crisis in the real estate with spillover effects on the labor whose in combination with higher oil affects consumer contributing importantly to depress even if the influence of monetary and fiscal stimulus can reduce the risk of a significant contraction in the dominant scenario continues to point to a more consistent recover only from even after significant strengthening of the capital basis of relevant financial uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the us subprime mortgages market crisis over us and european banking system and over credit conditions for households and the systemic risk perception increased again in the last as financial problems have worsened due to a cyclic deterioration in credit which tends to reinforce the tightening of financial increasing the risk of slowdown the dominant view seems to be that the economic activity in europe despite the performance at the start of the anchored in the german economy and in japan might also decelerate in the second half of the in the central the prospects for adoption of monetary tightening policies seem on the other despite some moderation at the economic growth in emerging economies is still strong so it has apparently been little affected by the us mortgage offsetting the effects of economic deceleration in mature in in light of pressures over the availability of production inflation acceleration points to the continuity of monetary tightening policies in emerging in this volatility and risk aversion indicators in international financial markets have increased considerably since the last copom the policies aimed at reducing the external vulnerability of the economy have been contributing to but not to the effects of the external scenario difficulties over the brazilian economic whose dynamism has essentially been driven by domestic oil systematic source of uncertainty stemming from the international continue highly volatile and are still in high historical this behavior reflects structural changes in global energy which have blocked the recovery of inventory levels traditionally in addition to recurrent geopolitical despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil prices the main scenario considered by the copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in although the probability of materialization of an alternative scenario is apart from the behavior of domestic gasoline one should recognize that the consistent elevation of international oil prices impacts domestic economy both through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of inflation the prices of other especially which have also increased significantly since the last copom despite more pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and the turmoil on global financial with few to record increases in the assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices were maintained at for the projections for electricity price adjustments and fixed telephone prices were maintained at and in the projection for regulated prices based on individual was maintained at for this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total june the projection for regulated prices inflation in was altered to from considered in the previous this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic rate based on the swap rates estimates a spread in the fourth quarter of and spread in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and increased by the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the june copom according to median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca variation increased reaching from ahead inflation expectations also elevated to up from considering the medians of expected monthly for inflation expectations also increased to up from considering the hypothesis under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased significantly compared to the figure considered at the june copom remaining above the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased remarkably compared to the figure considered at the previous copom and is also above the central target for the regarding projections based on both benchmark and market scenarios increased compared to the figures considered at the june and are also above the central policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion continues quite and is at least partially the cause of the inflationary despite strong imports growth and the favorable investment even in the context of a moderate deceleration of global growth and higher volatility observed in global markets since the committee based on information available at the moment of its that the balance of payments should not represent an imminent risk to the inflationary in general the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of brazilian inflation continues subject to contradictory effects and highly on the one the prospects of a possible more pronounced deceleration of global activity in the coming months points to an accommodation of both commodities prices and external on the other the recent trajectory of price indices both in mature and in emerging economies evidences the existence of mismatches between the supply and demand and of significant inflationary risks to the global in light of the deterioration of inflation in a more uncertain the committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario continues to the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last monetary policy should act so that initially limited impacts on price partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global do not cause persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics due to worse the copom thinks that the maintenance of monetary stability is an essential condition for the relative prices system to continue efficiently guiding the necessary adjustments on current consumption and production patterns of the the copom considers that the probability that inflationary pressures initially limited represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory has as the heating of domestic demand and market of as well as the possibility of emergence of supply restrictions in some may increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the committee evaluates that the prospects for this as well as for the propagation of initially localized pressures to consumer depend in a critical manner on inflation which increased significantly in the last weeks and continue to be carefully it is worth highlighting that although the external sector induces some discipline in tradable goods imports have been increasing heated domestic demand may trigger more intense inflationary pressures in the sector in services for in this the copom will act aiming to ensure that inflation control gains achieved in recent years become in this the committee will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as of inflation expectations within the forecast prepared to promptly adjust the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario in which price adjustments become persistent or the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longterm stable macroeconomic environment will contribute for the maintenance of the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has been occurring in the last the copom thinks that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that in brazil inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets even in light of global inflationary for this to it is necessary that inflation particularly the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and converge throughout the relevant period for the monetary the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming despite the more moderate credit growth pace due to an increase in funding and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the factors that will sustain but with less intensity than previously as mentioned in the previous copom meeting these considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate the dissemination of pressures stemming from adjustments in relative and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the last months of and in the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive it should be noticed that the possible accommodation of commodities prices could contribute to avoid that inflationary pressures intensify even the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by income and credit continues to present significant risks to inflationary in this the consistent and prompt reduction of the mismatch between the expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand continues to be vital to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy international evidence and brazilian experience indicate that higher inflation rates lead to higher risk shorter planning horizons as a lower potential economic besides having regressive effects on income in the current there is the risk that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary the strategy aims to bring inflation rates back to the midpoint target that already in this approach takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and has proved to be the most adequate to deal with uncertainties intrinsic in the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of the economy heating as illustrated by the acceleration of some wholesale prices and the evolution of core inflation and by the fast increase in inflation the risks for the materialization of a benign inflationary in which ipca would remain in line with the targets are in the deterioration of the scenario is already present in the inflation projections considered by the the copom also considers that the persistence of significant mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand has increased the risk for the inflationary in these monetary policy should act vigorously through the adjustment of the basic interest rate while the balance of risks to the inflationary dynamics in order on the one reduce such mismatch on the other avoid that inflationary pressures initially localized on price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation in this evaluating the macroeconomic scenario and aiming to promote the prompt convergence of inflation towards the target the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic target rate to without under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its domestic demand continues to expand backingup economic activity including sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive such as income are still on its the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary in light of robust domestic demand growth and the increase of global inflationary seems to become less at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that uncertainties contaminate longer time if the risk profile changes in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario considered at the present the committee will promptly adjust the monetary policy stance to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on september for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september of data analyzed by the copom inflation ipca increased in decelerating relative to the june and may ipca food and beverages prices increased contributing to the monthly index showing acceleration of the upward trend registered in april and market prices increased in down from in the previous with price elevations in tradable goods and goods regulated prices increased down from in the diffusion index

copom meeting shows consistent recovery of the brazilian the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook has been as economies grow this has so far contributed to support risk appetite towards emerging notwithstanding recent volatility of financial conditions in advanced the baseline inflation scenario has to a large as inflation developments remain with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable or low this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for collected by the focus survey are around expectations for and remain around percent and the path of administered prices underlying the conditional inflation scenarios produced by the copom assumes variations of percent for and percent for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and this scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends at percent per year and increases to during the course of under these the inflation projections for and stand around risks around baseline inflation scenario unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the december copom meeting the baseline inflation scenario involves risks in both on the one the combination of possible effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of present low inflation may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available all members agreed that the recovery of the economy has been more in this committee members believe that as economic activity inflation tends to converge to they reaffirmed the view as a result of current levels of slack in the marginal revisions in the intensity of recovery would not lead to material revisions in the expected path for regarding the global the committee confirmed that the evolution of the global economy has been with widespread economic signs are already emerging that labor market conditions have started to lift wages in some central there are also prospects that inflation rates in these economies will return to levels closer to their this reinforces the scenario of continuation of the monetary policy normalization process in central which should take place gradually in the baseline but the prospective trajectory of price and wage inflation may make this process more volatile and induce some tightening of global financial in this committee members once again highlighted the brazilian capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in the global given its robust balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospects of economic the copom pondered once more the risk bank of brazil the brazilian economy of a reversal in this benign global in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent years and all members agreed that the prospects for inflation to a large evolved as the committee assessed the current situation of the domestic electric power generation sector and incorporated the recent changes in tariffs into its baseline scenario for it also discussed the evolution of fuel both prices have become more volatile over the past regarding monetary there was consensus as in the case of other occasional relative price adjustments resulting from supply with anchored inflation monetary policy should only address the effects of these the committee reiterates that its reaction to possible changes in relative such as in food and possible adjustments of electric power tariffs and fuel will be that is to monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply the copom discussed the levels and the path of including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary some measures of underlying inflation were considered to be at comfortable levels while others at low the committee also discussed the extent to which their trajectories are compatible with convergence of inflation towards the target over the relevant horizon for monetary on the one the persistence of underlying inflation measures at low levels poses downward risks for the prospective inflation on the other expectation remains that the recovery of economic activity will contribute to lift underlying inflation towards target over the relevant the copom reaffirmed the view that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks in both the risk that effects of supply shocks and the propagation of the low current levels of inflation will lead to a prospective inflation as well as the risk of a setback in the global outlook in a context of frustration of expectations about the reforms and necessary the committee expressed the view that economic conditions with anchored inflation measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable or low inflation projections a little below target for and on target for and a level of economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary with interest rates below the structural although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of committee members expressed an understanding that current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the copom understands that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over all copom members agreed since its december meeting the economy and the balance of risks have to a large as and compatible with the selic rate reduction to percent per the committee then discussed the next step in conducting monetary it focused on assessing under what circumstances it would be appropriate to interrupt the process of monetary easing and in what context there would be room for additional moderate monetary easing at its march on the one the continuity of the environment with underlying inflation at comfortable or low with an increased risk of its would make room for such additional the same would occur in the case of changes in the balance of risks that result in a lower probability of an increase in risk premia and consequent increase in prospective on the other evolution of the economy in line with the baseline the more consistent recovery of economic and a worsening of the global outlook would favor the interruption of the easing in this the members of the committee discussed the level of flexibility to be maintained in the communication on the next step for monetary some members expressed a preference for a high level of favoring more symmetric communication about the next while others proposed to signal more strongly the possible interruption of the monetary easing cycle and to maintain freedom of but to a lesser all members concluded to be appropriate to signal provided the conjuncture evolves according to the baseline the interruption of the monetary easing process seems appropriate from the current all members deemed appropriate to communicate that this view for the next meeting might change in favor of an additional moderate monetary if the baseline scenario and balance of risks bank of brazil the committee reaffirmed its preference for communicating conditionalities on the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality that guides its this contributes to increase transparency and improve copom in this the members reaffirmed that the next steps in the conduct of the monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the brazilian economy are fundamental for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary policy and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the economy and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by percentage to percent per the committee judges that this decision is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with smaller and gradually increasing the committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural the copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over the evolution of the baseline in line with and the stage of the monetary easing cycle made it appropriate to reduce the selic rate by percentage point at this copom regarding the next provided the baseline scenario evolves as at this time the views the interruption of the monetary easing process as more this view regarding the next copom meeting might change in favor of an additional moderate monetary if the baseline scenario and balance of risks the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation projections and the following committee members voted for this ilan goldfajn carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes maurício costa de otávio ribeiro paulo sérgio neves de reinaldo le sidnei corrêa marques and tiago couto ipca inflation has increased on a recording in compared to in september and to in the last monthly result is in line with the expectations registered on the eve the ipca and is close to the expectations that prevailed at the end of ipca inflation reached slightly lower than half of the observed in the same period of trailing inflation reduced to in october from in the lowest level since the adoption of the in june ipca inflation acceleration in october was mainly driven by the increase in market prices up from in not entirely offset by the regulated prices decrease down from in amongst market tradable prices increased to in october up from in while prices increased to up from the price of services increased to compared to in september and in october partial november already captured by the suggest that the ipca change might be slightly above the expectations recorded on the days of the october copom despite the inflation acceleration in the last a benign inflation scenario continues to evolve in line with the targets with favorable prospects for inflation in the coming similarly to the headline ipca core inflation measures calculated by the bcb also increased in core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased to in compared to in september and in smoothed trimmed means core repeated the change observed in and has oscillated around since recording the strongest rigidity among the three core after registering no change in the trimmed means core increased in september and in despite the recent the cores continue to present a downward trend on a in the three measures reached and compared to and in the same period of the last on a trailing both the core inflation by exclusion and the trimmed means core stood below the midpoint of the also similarly to the headline on the other the smoothed core inflation has converged more slowly to the reaching in compared to in the twelve months ended in which is an expected behavior considering its implicit the general price index inflation hiked significantly in to compared to in september and in october in the year through the increased compared to in the same period of last in twelve months through the increased compared to through the inflation acceleration in october was mainly driven by the strong increase in wholesale agricultural the wholesale price index inflation reached in compared to in reflecting the increase in agricultural the highest elevation since november wholesale agricultural prices increased since june in the three months ended in as a result of the significant increase observed in the last five the agricultural prices inflation reached in twelve compared to a deflation in the wholesale industrial prices presented stability in the last with fuel prices decrease compensating elaborated food prices with the agricultural prices wholesale prices may not favorably contribute to a consumer prices accommodation as previously signalizing the exhaustion of one of the determinant factors of the disinflation observed in the last as highlighted in previous copom meeting the effects of the wholesale prices behavior over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation industrial according to ibge seasonally adjusted decreased in compared to the previous after two months of the contraction was but it was more intense than previously anticipated by the the decrease in manufacturing activity in september reached out of the activities with seasonally adjusted with highlights to automotive vehicles whose performance was affected by the strike in important vehicle on a moving average industrial production remained close to the record high observed last in industrial production expanded compared to the same month of last after increasing in in the year through industrial production reached compared to the same period of last while on a twelvemonth trailing industrial output reached in the third industrial production increased seasonally after reaching in the second for leading and coincident indicators suggest a recovery in relation to on a seasonally adjusted with an increase of the more stable moving average these results shall among other the normalization of the automotive sector due to the end of the strikes observed during september in of the main several incentive including the monetary easing already suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall continue in the coming disaggregated industrial data show expansions of in consumer goods production and in intermediate goods and a contraction in capital goods compared to the same month of the previous on a seasonally adjusted all segments with highlights to durable consumer goods production on the other this sector has leaded industrial activity growth in the year followed by capital goods production the growth of durable consumer goods production among other the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of the expansion of capital goods production is due to positive prospects for domestic and also to the influence of favorable international prices for some industrial labor market results remain with decreasing expansion of jobs creation and higher purchase power of the unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan areas reached in compared to in september and in october in the rio de janeiro metropolitan unemployment stood at the lowest rate for october months since the beginning of the ibge as a the average unemployment rate in the year through october was percentage points higher than that of the same period last notwithstanding the expansion in labor the number of employed people grew both in the year through october and on a trailing indicating that the pace of jobs creation remains in the purchase power of workers increased a and compared to the same month last for a expansion in the year through in real payrolls increased in the same an important factor for the growth of aggregate according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment increased a seasonally adjusted in september and in the compared to the same month last it reached in according to the ministry of labor and employment formal employment grew a seasonally adjusted in confirming the continuity of the ongoing in the last twelve it increased by the same observed in the year through mainly driven by the expansions of in civil construction and in the retail with the creation of jobs in october million in the last twelve formal job creation increased to after decreasing in june and ibge data recorded a seasonally adjusted robust growth in retail sales for august and for compared to the same months of last retail sales grew in september and in in the year through retail sales expanded by mainly driven by furniture and domestic appliances sales and and supermarket sales the positive performance of retail sales is not restricted to and but also comprises creditsensitive retail sales expansion is expected to continue in the coming fostered by positive labor market and income credit expansion and the monetary easing as well as by the recovery in consumer installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry reached in september compared to in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the considering adjusted the average installed capacity utilization through september was lower than that of the same period last although this difference has reverted on the august and september levels increased and compared to the same months last the decline in the average utilization partially reflects the improvements in the productive in recent data regarding output and absorption of capital goods suggest a robust ongoing expansion of in the year through the absorption of capital goods expanded by mainly driven by the increases in capital goods imports volume and in capital goods production civil construction inputs expanded by according to the same comparison despite the ongoing aggregate demand relevant aggregate supply imbalances are not anticipated in the coming as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust results in confirming previous copom assessments regarding important structural changes in the brazilian external in the year through the trade balance reached above the level reached in the same period last this result was driven by the record results of exports and imports trailing surplus through october reached a new record as a result of domestic demand imports have outperformed on the recording a new record high according to the same comparison in spite of this exports have also continued to reaching a new record high according to the same comparison as a robust external results are expected to continue in and the current account surplus stood at billion in reaching billion in the or of for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of regarding the international the uncertainties regarding the monetary policy stance in the us although additional interest rate increases cannot be the consensus points to the fact that the bulk of the domestic interest rate increase may have already on the other concerns about the fact that the monetary tightening cycle may have been excessive continued to increase the fear of a recession in the us with potential implications for the brazilian it bears so the limited effects of the less favorable international outlook observed in the last when the concerns stated above were already especially with regard to the increased risk aversion and the lower international in after an in the sovereign risk reached historically low levels in the last remaining stable during the electoral this fact corroborates recurrent expressed in previous press releases and inflation that the brazilian economy is more resilient to external in this the copom reaffirms that the continued robust and persistent trade the buildup of international adequate public primary improved public debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to external the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external another concern regarding the international oil has also oil prices slightly decreased since the last copom but nominal oil prices remain at historically high in oil prices still present high among other geopolitical it is worth mentioning that the dynamics observed in the last years to a great structural imbalances in the oil suggesting that permanent upward moves in oil prices have the future oil prices trajectory still encompasses great the scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in has become more likely to and the risks related to its materialization have decreased despite the stability in domestic gasoline changes in international oil prices affect domestic oil for through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of market inflation of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the octobert copom the projection for bottled and fixed line telephone prices adjustments in remained in and considering the same comparison the projections for household electricity adjustments in were changed to from the copom maintained the adjustment projection for all regulated prices in these according to the weights released by the represent of the total october the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to some regulated prices were projected considering the information the projection for the other regulated prices continue to be based on the endogenous determination this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the fourth quarter of reaching in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the october copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased to from this increase was mainly driven by the incorporation of the october inflation rate and an increase of inflation expectations for the remaining months of the ahead inflation expectations increased to from for inflation expectations decreased to from as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period increased compared to the values considered at the october copom remaining below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting also remained above the values considered in the october copom but below the central target for the on the other the projections for according to both reduced relative to the october remaining below the target in both monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that monetary policy has both contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic economic activity data still suggest low likelihood of significant pressure over imports expansion has contributed significantly to this complementing domestic production restricting potential inflationary effects of domestic demand despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international due to the interest rates increase in industrialized the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external the scenario for the inflation trajectory remains as in the october the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of anticipated favorable the copom evaluates that the inflation increase has been mainly driven by an expected upturn in food observed in the last since these effects have not it is likely that upcoming inflation indicators still capture those due to the nature of such they are expected to be with reduced intensity throughout without necessarily contaminating the copom will continue to conduct the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become for this to the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adapting the monetary stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important lags in monetary policy transmission to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has been reduced by with the greater part of the reduction concentrated in the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily concentrate on the prospects for inflation and the risks associated to its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in the october copom activity level should also reflect the effects of the governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred since the last quarter of and expected to continue next the effects of interest rates cuts will add up to other factors that will contribute to demand given the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission mechanisms and the lower distance between the current selic rate and the interest the copom understood that the maintenance of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real may demand a more cautious monetary easing this argument is even more relevant in light of the fact that the monetary policy decisions in the coming months will produce concentrated impacts for given the reasons stated the copom considered the convenience to reduce the selic target by basis the copom members consensually concluded that several factors would justify such and that such decision would contribute to increase the magnitude of the total adjustment to be there was no consensus that the lower pace of the monetary easing should start at the present three members of the copom voted for a reduction in the selic considering that the current balance of risks justifies such the majority of the members of the copom emphasized that the information available at the present moment would not justify a change in the pace of the monetary easing process underway and that it would be necessary to wait the evolution of the macroeconomic outlook until the next so that to consider the convenience to reduce the selic target by basis the copom decided to reduce in the selic target by basis points to without five votes were for the copom monetary policy while three votes were in favor of reducing the selic target by basis under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price despite the decrease in international financial markets some factors that caused heightened volatility in previous months still in such an the monetary authority must remain vigilant so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time in case of an exacerbation of the risk factors monitored by the the monetary policy strategy will be promptly adapted to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on january for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased in up from in the previous three of the nine surveyed groups presented negative household items transportation and communication amongst groups that presented positive it bears emphasizing the increase in the prices of food and mainly driven by the increase in the prices of meat and and the increase in the prices of personal mainly driven by the prices of household food contributed for the ipca result in the ipca rose by in the year through october and in the last twelve market prices accelerated in increasing by up from in the previous for a growth in the last twelve regulated prices posting in down from in the previous totaling in the last twelve amongst market tradable prices increased while prices rose by on a trailing tradable and prices increased and the increased in for cumulative changes of in the year and in the last twelve the ipa prices the with the largest weight in the accelerated in increasing up from in for cumulative changes of in the year through october and in the last twelve the grew only in the month down from in the previous reflecting the decreases in the prices of fuel fruit and the incc increased in up from in reflecting the higher increase in the prices of services and the acceleration in wholesale price inflation in october was mainly driven by the sharp increase in agricultural whereas industrial prices posted the agricultural ipa reached in up from in reflecting the rises in the prices of legumes and items whose contribution reached for ipa inflation and for igp according to the processing stages of only intermediate goods recorded price reduction the prices of final goods increased up from in the prices of raw materials totaling in up from in august and in two out of three ipca core inflation measures increased in october on a but all of them sustained their declining trend on a trailing the trimmed means core reached in up from in totaling in twelve the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at the same posted in totaling in twelve the core excluding household food and monitored prices totaled in up from in the previous reaching in the last twelve the core calculated by the fgv under the symmetric trimmed means reached in totaling in the year through october and in the last twelve the ipca diffusion index the number of items in the ipca registering price stood at in up from in september and in economic activity according to monthly retail sales increased a seasonally adjusted in three of the four activities with seasonally adjusted data furniture and home appliances clothing and shoes and beverages and tobacco only fuel and lubricants decreased on a basis retail sales increased in compared to september mainly driven by the increases in furniture and home appliances and in hypermarkets and supermarkets expanded retails including civil construction inputs and parts and grew in the year through sales in these activities increased and mainly driven by the favorable credit in the year through retail sales expanded by while expanded retail sales increased são paulo trade association data in seasonally adjusted by banco central do showed an

year through these indicators rose by and compared to the same period of capital goods production for energy increased for for mixed while capital goods production for agriculture fell in the same according to monthly industrial production decreased in september on a seasonally adjusted mainly driven by the decrease in manufacturing industry and in mining in the year through industrial output expanded by compared to the same period of with manufacturing and mining industries growing by and all use categories recorded output decreases on a seasonally adjusted capital intermediate and durable consumer goods production decreased by and as a result of the decrease of in durable consumer goods production and in and consumer goods in the year through compared to the same period of production in all use categories with highlights to the increases in durable consumer goods and capital goods totaling and seasonally adjusted data for industrial production showed a decrease in production in of the sectors mainly in vehicles which decreased reflecting interruptions in the production of some important manufacturers during among the activities that registered electronic material and communication equipment showed a expansion in cni manufacturing data decreased in hours worked in production and increased in real industrial sales in on a seasonally adjusted in the year through these two indicators increased by and compared to the same period of installed capacity utilization reached a seasonally adjusted in up from in the previous without seasonal installed capacity

in the global a scenario of low growth prospects in important advanced economies notably in the euro a more benign scenario is anticipated for the upcoming high unemployment rates in coupled with the efforts of fiscal consolidation and political are translated into investment retreat and in low on the other the composite leading released by the organization for economic cooperation and development referring to and the pmi coincident relative to october and signal improvements at the margin in several advanced and emerging with prospects of growth in line with the trend or above regarding monetary accommodative stances have prevailed in the advanced in emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate or low levels in the in the euro zone and in the price of the brent oil barrel has been volatile and has slightly increased since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have retreated while the ones relative to metals have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations changed in the twelve months through october of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price for the whole year of was maintained at unchanged relative to the value considered at the october copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly unchanged relative to the october copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions as well as price hikes and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this for the whole year of bottled gas prices are projected to increase by and the fixed telephone tariff is projected to decrease the same values considered at the october copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated for the whole year of retreated to below the value considered at the october copom and the projected cumulative adjustment for the set of regulated prices in was maintained at the same value considered at the october copom these projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus trajectories for is considered as the fiscal according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law project in a given the inflation projection considers as fiscal impulse the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca remained at for the median of the inflation projections decreased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the value considered at the previous copom it remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also decreased relative to the value considered at the october and also stands above the inflation for in the baseline the inflation forecast remained and in the market it relative to the figures considered at the october copom standing both above the for the third quarter of the inflation forecast stands above the target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity this year have with trend of intensification over the relevant horizon for the monetary there are improvements in advanced although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of domestic the committee highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international as well as the since the last of some tension and volatility episodes in the the copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses a more intense domestic activity pace in this and in the upcoming recent information indicate resumption of investments and continuity of household consumption the latter favored by public transfers and by the vigor in the labor market which reflects in historically low unemployment rates and in in domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than gdp growth rates and tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy by the expansion of credit by the program of public services and by the program of permission for oil among other regarding the external component of the aggregate the main scenario anticipates a more benign trajectory than that registered in recent the committee notes that the speed of materialization of these expected gains depends on the confidence strengthening of companies and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal for the conditions are created so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation on the one would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit in the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over despite the moderation the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent quarters enable a natural and expected correction in relative for the these movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is also important to highlight the the aforementioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the secondary effects stemming from and that would tend to materialize over longer can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it is in this the committee considers that it is appropriate to continue the ongoing adjustment pace of the monetary continuing the adjustment process of the basic interest initiated at the april the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to be relatively on the one household consumption tends to continue due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other favorable financial concessions of public expansion of oil exploration among create good prospects for the committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining despite the prospects of progress in the relevant these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the same the committee considers that the transmission of the effects of monetary policy actions over inflation occurs with at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on january for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the

outlook and baseline data on economic activity continue to indicate a gradual recovery of the brazilian the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook remains despite some decline in risks and a change in on the one risks associated with the normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies have on the other there was an increase in risks related to a slowdown in global as a result of several such as trade conflicts and various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate or comfortable this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and inflation projections in the scenario with selic rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand at around for and for this scenario among other a path for the selic rate that ends at and increases to over the course of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at and at in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for in the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the december copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both but with larger weight on the last two risks thus with on the one the high level of economic slack may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path of inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies the committee judges since its previous notably related to the global inflationary risks have discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of economic indicators and available in the members discussed evidence of some slowdown in activity in the fourth quarter of when compared to the previous taking into account the shocks that occurred during they concluded that the evolution of the economic activity is consistent with the baseline scenario of a gradual recovery of the brazilian copom members pointed out that an acceleration in the pace of the economic recovery will depend on the decrease in uncertainties regarding the approval and implementation of those of fiscal adjustments in the brazilian they also stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and the development of the brazilian regarding the global the committee members considered that it remains this number is the rounded average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom bank of copom some decline in risks and a change in the committee discussed the contrasting scenarios for the evolution of the us the first possible seems to have affected the us yield curve and stock markets in the last months of risk of a significant economic the second scenario assumes continuity of the vigorous economic the two scenarios have opposite effects on the conduct of the monetary policy by the copom members concluded at least until one of the scenarios becomes more risks associated with the normalization of monetary policy in the us have in they recognized given the slowdown in activity in some relevant the risks associated with a weakening in the global economy have the committee also noted that such as those associated with the continued expansion of international trade and could contribute to lower overall in this the copom members once again highlighted the capacity of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of payments and the environment of anchored inflation expectations and prospects of economic the members of the committee discussed the recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying they assessed that those measures are at appropriate or comfortable and that inflation projections indicate a convergence of inflation to target over the course of and this path is consistent with inflation which remain the copom members that the consolidation of this scenario in the medium and long terms depends on the pace of necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian the committee members judged that inflationary risks those related to the global have moderated since their last previous the members highlighted that upside risks to inflation remain and with larger weight on their balance of the committee concluded that the balance of risks remains albeit to a lesser the members of the committee discussed the best way monetary policy should be conducted in the face of uncertainties regarding economic they concluded that and perseverance in monetary policy even in the face of volatile is the best way to keep inflation on path towards the copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at appropriate inflation projected to move toward targets for and and high level of slack in the economy prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of the committee members expressed the view that the current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe accommodative monetary all members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on economic inflation the balance of risks and inflation the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the copom stresses that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess the estimates of this rate over the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its december meeting they unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the copom then discussed the advisability of signaling the future evolution of monetary all members considered that the current environment prescribes retaining greater flexibility in the conduct of monetary which requires refraining from providing indications of its next the members of the copom reinforced the importance of emphasizing their commitment to conducting monetary policy in order to maintain the path for prospective inflation in line with inflation the committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities in the conduct of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to transparency and enhances in this they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of notably those of a fiscal adjustments in the brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full effectiveness of monetary and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the bank of copom widespread benefits for the committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic monetary policy into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to target over the horizon relevant for the conduct of monetary which includes with a smaller and gradually increasing the committee reiterates that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for maintaining low inflation in the medium and long for the reduction of its structural interest and for sustainable economic the committee stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the selic rate at its current the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation forecasts and copom asserts that and perseverance in monetary policy even in the face of volatile have been instrumental in pursuing its primary objective of keeping the inflation path towards the the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn carlos viana de carolina de assis costa de ribeiro paulo neves de sidnei marques and tiago couto update of economic outlook and regarding the global the environment has deteriorated the conflict between russia and ukraine has led to a strong tightening in financial conditions and higher uncertainty surrounding the global economic in the supply shock resulting from the conflict has the potential of increasing inflationary which had already been rising both in emerging and advanced since the previous most commodities have registered strong price particularly the energy the reorganization of global production with the creation of redundancies in production and the supply of as well as changes in the management of inventories of goods the sense of an increased level of was further propelled by the conflict in europe and sanctions imposed to in these developments might have consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures on global turning to the brazilian gdp growth in came in higher than producing a slightly larger statistical effect for in retail and services indicators evolved slightly better than while industrial activity fell on the labor market indicators continued to show consistent job recovery in and january for on the one the rise in risk premia and the more intense tightening of financial conditions act to slow economic on the other copom still considers that economic growth tends to benefit from the performance of agriculture and albeit with lower volumes than projected in the previous and from the remaining effects of the normalization process of the particularly in the services sector and in the labor consumer inflation remains with increases spread among several and continues to be more persistent than the increase of industrial prices has not slowed down and should persist in the short while services inflation accelerated even recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile components and on items associated with core the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in its reference with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchasing power parity stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that rises to in and declines to during in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the energy flag is assumed to be in december of and given the recent volatility and the impact on its inflation projections due to the usual assumption for the oil price in the committee has also decided to at this an alternative this considered of higher assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve until the end of ending the year at usd and then start increasing per year in january in this inflation projections stand at for and for risks around the the scenarios for inflation encompass risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the increase in the prices of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a inflation in its on the other fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the risk in spite of the more favorable public accounts the committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations but considers that this risk is being partially incorporated in the inflation expectations and asset prices used in its the committee maintains the assessment of an upward asymmetry in the balance of discussion about the conduct of monetary uncertainties regarding the future of the current fiscal framework result in increased risk premia and raise the risk of deanchoring inflation this implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest this movement is already to some in the inflation expectations extracted from the focus as well as in the risk premia of several domestic the committee reiterates that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for sustainable economic weaknesses in the structural reform effort and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the conflict in europe adds further uncertainty and volatility to the prospective scenario and imposes a relevant supply shock in several the committee considered that the best practice recommends that monetary policy react to the effects of this type of as this practice takes into account the usual lags in the effects of monetary copom specifically evaluated the impact on its projections of the assumption for the path of oil in its usual the price per barrel starts from values around usd in march and rises to around usd by the end of extrapolating for the entire relevant horizon of monetary policy the oil price resulting from a particularly unusual global the committee noted that the current environment of high uncertainty and volatility demands serenity for the evaluation of the impacts of the current and decided to compare this assumption with the prices of oil future contracts negotiated in international markets as well as projections from the energy the committee observed that both converged to a price per barrel below usd by the end of copom then concluded that it would be appropriate to keep the usual assumption in the reference but to assume as more likely a scenario with an alternative assumption for the path of oil prices until the end of as of the committee decided to stick to its more conservative the committee considers that the disclosure of an alternative scenario is particularly useful and informative in a highly uncertain copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering the relative probabilities of the scenarios as well as the balance of risks for considering the greater weight assigned to the scenario with an alternative assumption for the inflation projections are above the upper limit of the target tolerance band for and around the target for as for the balance of the committee maintains the upward bias for the projections of its considering this bias due to asymmetric copom evaluated that its projections are above the upper limit of the target tolerance band for and still around the target for considering these results and the evaluation regarding the probability of each copom considered at this a monetary tightening cycle similar to the one used in its scenarios is the most the increase of at least in the projected interest rate cycle over the entire relevant since the previous copom weighed in the the projected interest rate path implies a significantly restrictive monetary policy which will mainly impact inflation for and is compatible with tackling effects of the current supply should the prospective scenario prove to be closer to that observed in the reference the committee believes that this cycle should be even more copom assessed the appropriate pace of interest rate for it analyzed its inflation projections using simulations with monetary policy paths with different terminal adjustment and duration of monetary given the volatility and uncertainty of the current particularly in the global the committee opted for a timelier interest rate trajectory than that embedded in its this preference expresses caution regarding the probabilities awarded to its scenarios and the measurement of as well as its commitment to the convergence of inflation and expectations to its targets over the relevant based on these copom members discussed the most appropriate the committee concluded that a further adjustment of percentage followed by an additional adjustment at the same is the most appropriate strategy to achieve sufficient monetary tightening and to ensure inflation convergence over the relevant as well as the anchoring of the committee recognizes the challenging scenario for the convergence of inflation to its targets and reinforces that it will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening should the scenario evolve monetary policy taking into account the assessed the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective an even variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary which includes without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into an even more restrictive the actions aim at curbing the effects of the current supply shock in several which appear in inflation in a lagged the current projections indicate that the interest rate cycle in its scenarios is sufficient for inflation convergence to levels around the target over the relevant the copom judges that the moment requires serenity to assess the size and duration of the current if those shocks prove to be more persistent or larger than the committee will be ready to adjust the size of the monetary tightening the committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets for the next the committee foresees another adjustment of the same the copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fernanda rumenos costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de the indicators released since the last copom meeting suggest economic activity below expectations in the short forecasts for and gdp and the process of recovery of expectations components of confidence indices was after breaking a long sequence of negative prints in the second the measure of investment in the national accounts fell again in the third the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment after the decline in economic activity indicators for the absence of a reversal in the following months makes it less likely that these movements reflect natural fluctuations in economic activity around stabilization there is a higher that the recovery of economic activity will be slower and more gradual than previously the global outlook is particularly the increase in asset price volatility indicates the possible end of the benign period for emerging there is a high probability of resumption of the process of normalization of monetary conditions in the united states in the short as well as uncertainty over the future course of its economic returning to the domestic recent inflation figures came in more favorably than partly due to the reversal of food price but also with signs of more widespread these results contributed to a decrease in expectations for inflation measured by the focus which stand at around as for ipca inflation expectations reported in the same survey have declined to around and expectations for and more distant horizons remain around the path of regulated which enters the conditional forecasts in the inflation scenarios produced by the assumes increases of in in and in unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the previous copom the reference scenario among other that the interest rate and exchange rate remain unchanged throughout the forecast horizon per annum and the market scenario considers the paths for the policy rate and the exchange rate extracted from the focus in this scenario assumes exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rates of and at the end of the same for the projections under the reference and market scenarios retreated to around over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary the conditional forecasts fluctuated around the previous levels due to factors with opposing forecasts for in the reference and market scenarios show inflation around and forecasts for inflation in the reference and market scenarios are around and risks around baseline inflation scenario signs of at the in the process of disinflation of some ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy the inflation rate of these components has been retreating in but the pause at the according to seasonally adjusted monthly measures of underlying this could reflect greater inflation despite the high level of economic on the other the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity tend to produce disinflation that can be more intense than the one reflected in inflation expectations measured by the focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the in the more favorable inflation dynamics in the recent period show signs of more widespread it reasonable to expect softer economic activity in the short run and the prospect of a further delayed and more gradual recovery to reinforce this another likely outcome of this outlook would be an earlier end to the pause and resumption of at extended consumer price bank of brazil of the aforementioned ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary the steps toward approval of fiscal reforms have been positive so which suggests greater timeliness and higher probability of on the other the process is lengthy and carries the reduction of uncertainty would enhance the effects of monetary and reduce the costs of the ongoing disinflationary the possible end of the benign period for emerging economies might make disinflation more it is that its effects be mitigated by favorable movements in commodity prices that are relevant to the terms of which would be a stabilizing the end of the benign period may imply tighter external financial which would contribute a disinflationary there is no direct relationship between the global outlook and the conduct of monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in the short in light of the most recent they all agreed that the economy continued to show signs of weakness past september releases and indicators available for october and november failed to show a reversal that should be expected in a scenario of natural fluctuations of economic activity around stabilization this increases the likelihood that the resumption of economic activity may be further and be more gradual than previously regarding the global the committee members pointed out the risks associated with the possible end of the relatively benign environment for emerging economies of they all agreed that the process of normalization of monetary policy in the united states should be resumed in the near and that the course of its economic policy became a source of the copom evaluated that part of this uncertainty should dissipate in the coming they also agreed that by the end of the year the committee should have a more accurate assessment of the possible impacts of the resumption of the process of monetary policy normalization in the united the members of the committee argued in face of expectations that global economic activity will movements in the terms of trade may mitigating they also considered should a change in the global outlook produce relative price its impact on monetary policy will be circumscribed by its effects on in a context of anchored inflation these effects tend to be mitigated by the high degree of economic the committee analyzed its conditional forecasts for inflation in different the balance of the wide array of available and the evolution of the factors emphasized by the copom in its october statement in this the copom considered that the recent monetary policy stance contributed to the anchoring of inflation and to create more leeway for the easing of monetary the discussion turned then to the pace of some committee members reasoned that the more favorable inflation developments the positive steps toward the approval of the first fiscal reforms and the downgrade in the prospects for the recovery of economic activity would already support a faster pace of monetary easing at the current other copom members argued that the evolution of some inflation components that are more sensitive to the business cycle and to monetary policy continue to indicate a at the they also argued that the uncertainty over the possible end of the benign global environment for emerging economies should decrease until the january copom the combination of such factors recommended waiting until the next these same members that if economic activity fails to show clearer signs of it is reasonable to expect an intensification of the pace of monetary since in this case inflation forecasts should in the a consensus was built on waiting until the next the members of the committee discussed the path for regulated prices and its effects on the prospective scenario for in the members of the committee the impact of the change in fuel price policy that was recently possible changes in electricity prices during as a result of the fare hikes required to correct past policy in this the members of the committee once that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would enable the copom to focus on preventing effects of these relative price all members of the committee recognized the progress made and efforts for approval and implementation of the necessary adjustments in the bank of brazil especially with respect to fiscal the members of the committee emphasized that these efforts are crucial for the stabilization and the development of the brazilian the committee should monitor these efforts since they have important implications for the disinflation the committee understands that the pace of monetary easing will be taking into account its inflation projections and its determinant in order to pursue a path that allows the inflation targets for and to be the committee judges that currently there is no incompatibility between these two inflation forecasts for both years have especially in the market this suggests that there may be more room for monetary easing than previously the committee discussed the factors determining the pace and magnitude of monetary in it was pointed out that the palpable risk that a timely recovery of economic activity fails to materialize should allow the intensification of the pace of monetary monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the current balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to percent per without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes and is compatible with a gradual easing of monetary the magnitude of monetary easing and the speeding up of its pace will depend on inflation forecasts and and on the evolution of the aforementioned risk in that the copom emphasizes that the pace of disinflation in its forecasts might intensify if the economic recovery is delayed and occurs more gradually than this intensification of the disinflation process relies on an adequate global there is no mechanical between the global outlook and monetary the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes luiz edson otávio ribeiro reinaldo le sidnei corrêa marques and tiago couto update of economic outlook and baseline data on economic activity released since the previous meeting indicate the continuation of the process of gradual economic the global despite the recent increase in the provision of monetary stimulus in major economies has been able to generate relatively favorable environment for emerging the committee judges that various measures of underlying inflation are running at levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the hybrid scenario with a constant exchange rate at the interest rate path from the focus survey yields inflation projections around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and constant exchange rate at yields inflation projections around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation on the other the current degree of monetary which affects the economy unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the december copom meeting may produce a path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case of an increase in the monetary policy power due to the changes in financial intermediation and in credit and capital a deterioration of the outlook for emerging or a possible frustration with the continuation of reforms and the perseverance in the necessary adjustments in the brazilian discussion about the conduct of monetary copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available information and they assessed that the data released since their previous meeting indicatea dichotomy between labor market developments and growth in the production of goods and while the labor market continues to recover recent industrial production data and preliminary investment indicators have performed worse than in this copom members also discussed the size of the economic some members assessed that the exhaustion of the centralized capital allocation model and the long duration of the recession may have produced supply in this the aforementioned dichotomy suggests that there may be less economic slack than that measured by traditional other members stressed that the dynamics of the core despite the recent effects of the protein price signals that the economic slack is still copom members also evaluated the evolution of financial conditions they concluded that the conditions are despite some volatility inherent to those the environment with benign financial conditions results from the increase in the degree of monetary the relatively favorable global environment for emerging economies and the prospects for the economics fundamentals in the brazilian as a result of the reform agenda and necessary the committee also discussed the characteristics of the current business with smaller role for the government in the and its possible implications for monetary some copom members pointed out that changes in credit value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom financial such as the greater role played by credit and capital must have an impact on the transmission channel of monetary copom members also conjectured on the sensitivity of macroeconomic variables to monetary as we lack historical precedent in the brazilian history for the current degree of copom members judge that changes in the credit and capital markets tend to bolster the power of monetary regarding the global committee members deemed the scenario relatively favorable for emerging the committee discussed the effects of the coronavirus on the global a prolongation or intensification of the outbreak would imply an additional deceleration of global with impacts on commodity prices and important financial the copom members concluded that the consequence of these effects to monetary policy conduct will depend on the relative magnitude of the global economic slowdown versus the reaction of financial in the relevant horizon for monetary the scenario with the interest rate path from the focus survey and the constant exchange rate results in inflation below the target and around the projections were particularly affected by the effects of the protein price shock after manifesting themselves more intensely than expected at the end of have already showed a partial reversal at the beginning of regarding administered the benign conditions for the occurrence of minor adjustments in electricity rates the copom members assessed that the economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at levels compatible with meeting the inflation scenarios with projected inflation below or around the target for the relevant horizon of monetary and elevated economic slack prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural the committee members expressed the view that the current level of real interest rates provides stimulus to the given the multiple uncertainties regarding the current size of economic the speed of economic and the increase in the power of monetary which acts with lags in the the copom considers that it is important to observe the effects of the monetary stimulus cycle that started in the committee judges that a better understanding of these effects is essential to determine the next steps in monetary the committee believes in a context of anchored inflation the protein antecipated inflation from to given that there are uncertainties regarding the lag and the magnitude of the effects of the stimulus already the copom believes that it is essential to observe the evolution of economic activity and inflation projections and expectations over the next with increasing weight for monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate by percentage point to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with increasing the copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural thecopomseesprogressintheprocessofreforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy but emphasizes that persevering in this process is essential to allow for the consolidation of the reduction of the structural interest rate and for a sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic the copom judges that the current stage of the business cycle recommends caution in the conduct of monetary in light of the lagged effects of the monetary easing cycle that began in july the committee deems appropriate to interrupt the monetary easing the committee emphasizes that its next steps will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and with increasing weight for the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and reference regarding the global the environment remains less more persistent inflation raises the chances of faster monetary tightening in

previous most commodities reversed the decline observed at the end of the year in some reached recent reinforcing the global environment of pressured turning to the brazilian economic trade and services indicators showed a slightly evolution in while industry recovered in labor market indicators showed consistent job recovery in for on the one the rise in risk premia and the more intense tightening of financial conditions act stifling the economic on the other hand copom still considers that economic growth tends to benefit from the performance of agriculture and livestock and from the remaining effects of the normalization process of the particularly in the services sector and in the labor confidence indexes released since the previous meeting continue to and weather developments have affected the projections for important agricultural consumer inflation remains with increases spread among several and continues to be more persistent than the increase of industrial prices has not slowed down and should persist in the short while services inflation still reflecting the gradual normalization in the recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile components and particularly on the items associated with core the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in its reference with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchasing power parity stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that rises to in the first half of ends the year at and drops to during in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the energy flag is assumed to be level in december of and regarding administered the revision was mainly due to the strong increase in oil prices since the previous meeting of the as well as administered items whose variations will be repeated throughout the these pressures were only partially offset by the change in the hypothesis of the energy flag for the end of which reflected the improved rainfall risks around the reference inflation the reference scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a inflation in the reference on the other fiscal policies that imply additional impulses to aggregate demand or deteriorate the future fiscal path may have a negative impact on prices of important financial assets as well as pressure the risk in spite of the more favorable public accounts the committee assesses that the uncertainties regarding the fiscal framework maintain elevated the risk of deanchoring inflation expectations the upward asymmetry in the balance of this implies a higher probability of inflation paths above the one projected under the reference discussion about the conduct of monetary uncertainties regarding the future of the current fiscal framework result in increased risk premia and raises the risk of deanchoring inflation this implies assigning greater probability to alternative scenarios that consider higher neutral interest the committee reiterates that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic weaknesses in the structural reform effort and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the committee notes that even fiscal policies that have a downward effect on inflation in the short term can cause a deterioration in the risk increase inflation and consequently have an upward effect on prospective copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the reference but also the balance of risks for according to the reference which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and the exchange rate evolving according to the purchasing power the inflation projections are above the upper limit of the tolerance band of the target for and around the target for as for the balance of the committee pondered that the risk of deanchoring derived from developments in the fiscal sustains an upward bias for the projections of its reference considering this bias due to asymmetric copom evaluated that its projections are above the target for both and copom once more concluded that the monetary tightening process should be more restrictive than that used in the reference scenario throughout the relevant copom assessed the appropriate pace of interest rate for it analyzed its inflation projections using simulations with monetary policy paths with different terminal adjustment and duration of monetary it is worth noting that the scenarios consistent with the convergence of inflation to its assumed a higher interest rate path than that used in the reference based on these copom members discussed the most appropriate the committee concluded that another adjustment of percentage followed by additional adjustments at a slower pace in the next is the most appropriate strategy to achieve sufficient monetary tightening and ensure inflation convergence over the relevant as well as the anchoring of inflation the particularly high uncertainty surrounding important asset and commodity as well as the stage of the tightening led the committee to judge more at this not to signal the size of its future monetary policy taking into account the reference the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its reference scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary which includes to a larger without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given the increase in its inflation projections and in the risk of deanchoring it is appropriate to advance the process of monetary tightening significantly into the restrictive the committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets for its next the committee foresees as at this a reduction in the pace of adjustment of the interest this indication reflects the stage of the tightening cycle as its cumulative effects will manifest themselves over the relevant the copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fernanda rumenos manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the advancement of the immunization programs should promote a more robust economic recovery throughout the economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these and the associated repricing of financial could result in a more challenging environment for emerging turning to the brazilian recent particularly the gdp growth in the fourth quarter of continued to suggest a consistent economic recovery in spite of the reduction in the emergency income in higher frequency indicators suggest that this movement probably stretched until but this view requires caution given the greater difficulty in applying seasonal due to recent volatility of data series and the changes to the holiday schedule at the state the latest readings do not capture the effects of the recent sharp increase in the number of uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than especially for the first and second quarters of this the various measures of underlying inflation are in levels above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the continuing increase in commodity measured in local is affecting current and has triggered additional increases in inflation forecasts for the next especially through its effects on fuel despite these stronger and more persistent than expected inflationary the committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary but continues to closely monitor its the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the worsening of the pandemic may delay the economic producing a prospective inflation on the other an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravates the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the relative increase in the risks of these events implies an upward asymmetry to the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the committee assessed that the progress in the implementation of immunization the new fiscal stimuli in some developed and the communication by central banks of major economies that monetary stimuli will be should imply robust economic growth during the the discussion about reflation has increased volatility in some this repricing of important financial assets could result in a more challenging environment for emerging the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they evaluated despite the partial reduction in governmental emergency transfer the economic recovery has been better than they noted that the latest available data do not yet account for the possible effects of the recent sharp increase in the number of and that there is considerable uncertainty about the pace of economic growth in the first and second quarters of this looking the committee assessed that a possible economic recovery setback due to the worsening of the pandemic would be less extreme than the one observed last year and would probably be followed by another fast for the the second half of the year may show a robust as the effects of vaccination are felt more the copom members debated on the level of economic the committee believes that the pandemic produced heterogeneous effects across economic and that governmental emergency transfer programs reduced the slack in the goods the copom judges that economic activity and formal labor market data suggest that the overall slack has declined faster than despite the increase in the unemployment the copom turned to the monetary policy in the in addition to the strong pace of growth in recent with a consequent reduction in economic there has been a reversal in inflation these expectations have moved to the upper part of the tolerance interval of the inflation target for and to around the target for the two calendar years within the relevant monetary policy as a the copom members concluded that the current scenario ceased to prescribe an extraordinary degree of and that the copom should begin a process of partial normalization of the policy the copom then discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate trajectory extracted from the focus the inflation projections are near the upper bound of the tolerance interval in and around the target in committee pondered despite the recent approval of important which will bring benefits in the medium the fiscal risks remain high in the short term due to the worsening of the which implies an upward bias to these asymmetry in the balance of risks affects the appropriate degree of monetary justifying a trajectory with a larger initial increase in the policy rate than that implied by the baseline the committee also highlighted that the delay in the normalization of the production which puts pressure on production costs and inflation in specific suggests that there is also a positive demand shock at members also stressed that the inflationary pressures observed in may affect inflation expectations for risking a of expectations over the relevant horizon for monetary regarding the recent dynamics of the committee pointed out despite the diagnosis that the current shocks are the brazilian inflation targeting regime aims at headline inflation in the calendar all these factors have contributed to a more assertive stance in the conduct of monetary based on all these the committee concluded that an initial adjustment of in the selic rate would be the most this swifter adjustment of the degree of stimulus is compatible with meeting the target over the relevant even in a scenario of a temporary increase in social the committee assessed that for the next meeting it would be appropriate to continue the process of partial normalization of the monetary stimulus with another adjustment of the same the copom reinforced that its views for the next meeting may be altered if there is a significant change in the inflation projections or the balance of and the decision will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and the inflation projections and monetary policy considering the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the copom members consider that the current conditions ceased to prescribe an extraordinary gdp ended growing strongly at the recovering most of its first and inflation expectations rose above target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation projections increased to levels close to the upper bound of the target for the copom decided to start a process of partial normalization by reducing the extraordinary degree of monetary for all the aforementioned the committee considered appropriate an adjustment of in the selic in the a swifter adjustment has the benefit of reducing the probability of not meeting the inflation target in as well as of keeping longer horizon expectations well the broad set of information available to the committee suggests that this strategy is consistent with meeting the inflation even if social distancing increases for the next unless there is a significant change in inflation projections or in the balance of the committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another of the same in the degree of monetary the copom emphasizes that its view for the next meeting will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro damaso and paulo neves de ipca inflation accelerated from in december to in january and in as a inflation accumulated in the first two months of reached level equivalent to the registered in the same period of the previous in the last twelve after declining from in december to in inflation increased again to in february in february the acceleration of consumer price trailing inflation mirrors the behavior of regulated as there was no change in market both prices of tradable goods and goods cooled on a trailing reaching and down from and in december despite the acceleration relative to the levels observed in the same month of the previous according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of as evidenced by the intense increase in the prices of education in february increased from in december to in january and in february in february preliminary data for march point to consumer inflation below that observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed in the last quarters tends to be gradually overcome by a process that should be led by the behavior of market while regulated price inflation should show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed divergent behavior in the first months of the the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices decreased from in december to in january and then increased to in reflecting seasonal smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures showed lower recording in and in and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core remaining in levels above the midpoint of the it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion which remarkably increased in on a and continued to point to an inflationary process relatively reduced in february in january to in compared to in february the general price index inflation changed in january and in february up from in on a trailing the inflation decreased from in december to in january and in compared to in february the slowdown of the has reflected the behavior of its main the wholesale price index which decreased from in december to in on a trailing basis in february on its the consumer price increased in february according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in february regarding the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of agricultural the agricultural ipa increased in february while the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached in february it bears noticing despite the effects of the exchange rate depreciation that has occurred since the third quarter of last wholesale industrial prices have showed deflation at the as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation the ibge and geography brazilian released information about fourth quarter the data showed a slowdown in both for accumulated results in the year down from accumulated in the first three and for results down from in the previous on the aggregate demand the expansion was led by public administration which increased in the fourth the gross fixed capital formation increased and household consumption growth grew according to the same comparison sustained by the increase in real the contribution of domestic absorption to the gdp growth totaled in the fourth quarter of overweighting the negative impact exerted by the external on the aggregate supply still according to the same the services sector presented the best growing by followed by agriculture and which decreased relative to the same period of the deflator under market on a changed from in the third quarter of to in the fourth on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased in after falling by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted according to the after the retreat observed in industrial output increased by in on a industrial output retreated by in with respective falls of and in mining and manufacturing data released for the last months in to the interruption of the industrial production expansion cycle since the last quarter of the industrial activity has been influenced by the international due to its effects both over exports and credit and over business and in this several industrial segments have been led to adjust inventories and reduce a process that has recently been particularly evident in the intermediate goods among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of capital goods decreased by in but increased in regarding the other use intermediate goods production decreased in december and increased in consumer goods production decreased in december and in and the production of durable strongly influenced by the automotive reduced by in and increased by in the recent slowdown in capital goods production reflects the persistence of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business on its the cooling in the pace of expansion of durable goods production the tightening in credit the deterioration of consumer expectations and the process of reduction mentioned such developments should continue to be evidenced by the data relative to the first months of the current despite with some recovery at the labor market started to record ambiguous combining positive aspects with significant accommodation of formal job creation at the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey changed from in november to in december low in the historical but increased to in up from in january according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate stood stable around between november and but increased to in average real earnings increased by in in but increased in according to the same comparison resuming acceleration after three months of slowdown in the growth on its expanded by in december and in in as a real payroll increased in december and in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment retreated by in after decreasing by in december and in in employment declined according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment fell in december falling in november and in totaling a increase in and a decline still regarding labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate significant loss of dynamism in the generation of formal employment since the end of in jobs were dismissed to the negative result of in the manufacturing industry recorded the highest dismissal with the reduction of followed by the commerce which habitually dismisses in this period of the with the reduction of on the other the civil construction sector and the services sector hired workers in the and according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales decreased by in after decreasing in on a the indicator increased by resulting in growth in the the moving average of expanded retail sales decreased in according to seasonally adjusted on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of material and and parts and the negative key drivers were and and in the cumulative growth was more significant in material and and personal and domestic after falls in november and expanded retail sales data for january and february should evidence a recovery influenced mainly by increase in the sales of in response to the sector incentives granted by the this recovery was captured by the data from the national federation of distribution of automotive vehicles for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of but it will also be affected by the evolution in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in below the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing industry also reaching in down from in without the seasonal in january the nuci stood below the level registered in the same month on its the monthly adjusted nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas retreated strongly in to standing below the level registered in the same month of the reduction in the is also observed in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and civil construction inputs the reduction on nuci calculated by cni and fgv seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic and points to significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing on the other recent data about the absorption of capital goods indicate continuity in the slowdown of the absorption of capital goods decreased in according to seasonally adjusted and by in according to observed in its the production of civil construction inputs increased at the margin in after decreasing in falling in evidences so far suggest an ongoing process of reduction in demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the accumulated trade balance has been showing stability at the under this the trade surplus reached billion in decreased to billion in january and increased to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts on the opposite the reduction in remittances of profits and dividends has acted to limit the current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress on international financial which originated in the us and but whose impact on emerging economies has continued to be despite the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the us and using wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money systemic risk perception is still in the contraction of international liquidity has continued to contribute to a process of deleverage by asset in has been pressuring down the prices of financial in an environment of increased risk aversion and shortage of capital the volatility of emerging currencies remains despite not showing the generalized trend of depreciation against the us dollar observed in the last months of regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary the predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in recovering just in the consensual projections point to an intense retraction of activity in europe and which be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in europe and parts of asia was in a significant manner due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities prices in which was allowing an increase in available income in these on the other the problems in the international financial system have continued to be aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of focused on the us and which tends to reinforce the contraction in financial conditions as a the risk of intensification in the in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has inflationary pressures have reduced in emerging where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more inflationary pressures have also been although they in many more in this while the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature in emerging in addition to the facts already have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation the expansionist stance has been more at the same the authorities in western europe and asia have been announcing a series of initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal which could contribute to a gradual economic the estimates on the fiscal costs for packages of macroeconomic stimulus and support to the financial sector have been which has caused pressures on the assessment of risk on many sovereign even in advanced oil prices remain despite currently being close to the levels observed at the last copom future markets quotations have also shown without a defined uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the prospects for evolution of global in a scenario of uncertainties regarding the implementation and maturation of investments in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this the main scenario adopted by the which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in remains with the persistence of the current scenario in the oil it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis of price reductions in it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline the reduction in international oil prices observed since the second half of can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation the prices of agricultural commodities such as soybeans and have reduced since the last copom reacting both to the perspectives of reduction in demand and to the accumulation of of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following similarly to the january copom the projected adjustment for for both gasoline and bottled gas prices stood at the projected adjustment for fixed telephone for was kept unchanged at same value considered in the january copom while the expected adjustment for electricity prices was reduced to the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual was maintained unchanged at compared to the january copom this set of according to data released by corresponded to of the total february the projection of regulated prices inflation for remained unchanged at compared to the january copom such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic on the benchmark based on the swap estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca change reduced to down from for inflation expectations stood at the same projection observed in the january considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca decreased relative to the figure considered at the january copom meeting and remains below the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also decreased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom meeting and is below the central inflation projection for based on the benchmark slightly decreased compared to the figure considered in the last copom meeting and is significantly below the central while on the market it has also staying below the central policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic economic activity available data indicate that the pace of domestic demand expansion has significantly cooled since the last months of amidst a significant generalized economic activity deceleration in other developed and on its the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedented constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international unseen over the last few continue to impose adjustments in the balance of in general the influence of the external scenario over the future path of brazilian inflation continues to be subject to apparently contradictory which can act with distinct intensity throughout surrounded by significant on the one the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk impacting the demand for brazilian assets and depreciating their on the other the more generalized economic deceleration observed in the last months despite not may persist in the upcoming has caused the cooling of both commodities prices and external also negatively impacting local financial the trajectory of price indices evidences the reduction of external inflationary especially in mature but also in some emerging as a the net effect of the global deceleration over domestic inflation path seems to so predominantly copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last when inflation targets were systematically the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risk to domestic inflation trajectory continues to evidences of substantial accommodation of domestic demand and moderation of pressures over the market of despite remaining subject to should reduce the risk of of upward observed through the end of of wholesale prices have been showing deflation over the last few to consumer the committee evaluates that the materialization of this as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer still depends critically on economic inflation in inflation expectations for remain in levels above the inflation in spite of some reduction since the last copom and continue to be closely it is worth noticing according to available the behavior of domestic demand should exert lesser pressures over the prices of such as in the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation this point of view is even more important in periods surrounded by heightened prospects for the evolution of economic activity have continued to deteriorate since the last copom although industrial activity data have been partially reflecting a process of inventory which tends to fade over it is particularly important to notice that the effects of the international crisis over domestic financial have resulted in severe decline of the credit contribution to domestic demand the intensification of the international crisis has caused negative effect on consumers and businessmen under such the economic activity dynamism tends to increasingly rely on payroll expansion and on the effects of the possibly enhanced governmental transfers that should occur in on the other the contracting effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context of monetary despite not may become these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts over the upcoming the copom evaluates that the loss of domestic demand dynamism should result in the reduction of inflationary on its the remaining risks for the inflationary dynamics derive from the trajectory of brazilian asset amidst a process of decreasing external sources of funding and mechanisms of price adjustments that contribute to prolong inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior of the prices of services and regulated items during the beginning of the balance of those influences over the prospective trajectory of inflation will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk both for private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation resumes the midpoint target path in as established by the and to keep it in level consistent with the targets path for such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of signs of economic activity for industrial production indicators by an inventory certain available data on labor market and industrial capacity utilization as well as on businessmen and consumers and of lower inflation expectations for relevant the prospects for the materialization of a benign inflation in which ipca would resume evolution in line with target have been the evolution of the prospective scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the despite there is still some scope for an easing monetary policy should be cautiously aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets the committee believes that the demand stemming from the tightening of financial the deterioration of confidence and global economic activity has created significant idleness margin of production such development should contribute to restrain inflationary even in light of the consequences of the adjustment process of the balance of payments and the presence of mechanisms of inflation feedback in the making room for a monetary policy easing on the other in addition to the fact that changes on the basic interest rate have effects over activity and inflation that accumulate over the evaluation about the scope for some additional monetary policy easing also takes into account aspects resulting from the long periods of high still embedded within the financial system institutional in such taking into account the macroeconomic copom has unanimously at the to reduce the selic rate to without the committee will monitor the evolution of the inflation scenario until its next considering the magnitude and speed of the basic interest rate adjustment already implemented and its cumulative in order to define the next steps of its monetary policy under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prices and the balance of risks associated to the there are signs after a long period of domestic demand has started to have a contractionist influence over economic despite persistence of stimulus such as income it is worth noticing that inflationary expectations for have decreased since the last committee on the other the deceleration of economy has generated downturn pressures over wholesale despite the exchange rate under such monetary policy can be more flexible without putting at risk inflation convergence to the targets if deterioration on the risk profile implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic scenario considered by the committee at this the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the at the end of the it was announced that the committee would reconvene on april for technical presentations and on the following to discuss monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom the ipca increased in decelerating relative to the february and accelerating relative to the january ipca in the last twelve months through the ipca reached up from observed in reaching in the february result was influenced by the increase in the costs of education which contributed representing of ipca change in as a result of the typical readjustments of this group at the start of the market prices reflecting the increase in education reaching in up from in while regulated prices reached down from in the same on a trailing market prices increased in february same change observed in while regulated prices reached up from over the previous the diffusion index reached down from in the lowest level recorded since march the core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in up from in reaching over twelve compared to in the previous the smoothed trimmed means core reached relative to in increasing by over the last twelve months in the previous the trimmed means core increased in down from and reached in twelve months in the previous the decreased in compared to a increase in accumulating a decrease over the year and a increase in the last twelve the ipa price decreased in reflecting lower prices on both agricultural products and on industrial products on a the ipa increased with a increase in industrial prices and in agricultural it bears highlighting significant deceleration in the twelve months through december and and the decelerating from in january to in reaching in twelve the incc increased in down from in reaching in the last twelve the core reached in down from in reaching in twelve analyzing the ipa by stages of the prices of final goods increased in while the prices of intermediate goods and gross raw material decreased and in the last twelve months through these three segments increased and the consumer price increased over the first week of compared to in activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly survey expanded retail which include construction supplies and vehicles and parts and decreased in after decreasing in november and in four out of the ten segments surveyed by the ibge expanded with highlights to office material and equipment and parts and pieces which benefitted from the ipi products in october and automobile industry sales decreased by and among the segments that declined relative to it bears noticing the performance of construction material deepening the contraction observed in the two previous considering the comparisons between identical periods of and expanded retail sales increased in growing by in in it bears emphasizing a decrease in sales of clothing and shoes parts and pieces and construction material according to the same comparison among the sectors with sales office material and equipment presented the best with a increase in all sectors with once for office material and which grew compared to according to são paulo trade association seasonally adjusted by the database consultations for credit sales related to the city of são paulo decreased by in on the other consultations to usecheque system expanded by in those indicators decreased and in the first two months of those indicators decreased and compared to the same period of automobile sales by which take into account light commercial trucks and declined in according to february data hit the second highest volume of sales in the historical according to seasonally adjusted february sales increased after a increase in according to the same comparison in the quarter ended in sales decreased regarding investment capital goods production increased in while the production of construction typical inputs increased considering the seasonally adjusted relative to january those indicators decreased and the positive margin increase on capital goods production reflected basically the expansion of segments of transportation equipment and for mixed use according the industrial survey conducted by of industrial companies plan to invest in in a lesser proportion than although of entrepreneurs responded that their productive capacity is adequate to the expected demand for the planned investments seek to improve quality and expand with focus on the domestic capital goods imports declined in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the january indicator decreased by down from the cumulative change signaling the significant downturn in the performance recently according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in after three consecutive months of according to the seasonally adjusted twelve of the activities surveyed reported monthly decline in with highlights to the negative performance in the sectors of appliances and electrical materials and miscellaneous by use still considering seasonally adjusted only the production of and consumer goods presented negative result capital intermediate goods and durable consumer goods production and in industrial production decreased in a record low for the series since its start in november all the use categories declined capital goods intermediate goods durable consumer goods and and consumer goods the cumulative industrial production expanded by in december and in evidencing deceleration at the vehicles production reached thousand units in according to decreasing considering data seasonally adjusted by the the production of vehicles increased in while the production in the last quarter stood below than the observed in the quarter ended in the cumulative production of vehicles and agricultural machinery increased by and in the last twelve months through the sales of domestic vehicles decreased in february but increased in twelve according to the same comparison vehicles exports decreased and cni indicators continued to show deceleration in the pace of industrial activity in with decreases of in real revenues and in the installed capacity according to data seasonally adjusted by the the hours worked was the only indicator that grew compared to january all indicators real revenues hours worked and installed capacity utilization the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in february pointed to the production of million tons in up from million tons estimated in the new estimate represents a decrease relative to the declines of and in the production of corn and were also products directly related to the basic food such as rice and should have their production expanded by and the ibge released information on the gdp performance of the fourth quarter of the data show a slowdown both for accumulated changes in the year down from in the previous and for results down from the in the previous according to data seasonally the gdp in the last quarter of decreased by on the supply according to the only the industry activity fell agriculture and services and on the demand household and government consumption and gross fixed capital formation increased and exports retreated and imports increased resulting in the twelfth consecutive quarter of growth driven exclusively by the domestic the domestic demand contributed for the increase of gdp in the last quarter of while the external sector contributed and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index decreased in reflecting the reduction of in the current economic conditions index and the rise of in the consumer expectations index the icc declined mainly due to the retraction of in the according to the fgv the icc decreased in reaching a record low for the series started in september this negative result was driven by the decrease in the current situation index and by the decline in the expectations index the survey also registered decreases of in the resulting in falls of in the isp and in the still according to the businessmen confidence in the industrial sector was kept virtually unchanged the first two months of after falling in the last quarter of remaining at a level below the industry confidence index reached points in seasonally increasing by point for the second consecutive the seasonally adjusted index recorded emphasizing the recovery of optimistic businessmen expectations about industrial among its and also in seasonally adjusted the current situation index leveled at below the january while the expectations index increased reaching by use all indicators increased in the but stood below consumer goods outperformed for being the use category with greatest confidence level and greatest level of recovery in the increasing up from points recorded by the general by industrial the segment of transportation material registered the most significant recovery in reaching points in the sectors of cellulose and paper and other products reached a record low for the historical food products and showed the slightest fall in the confidence of points and while the general industry retracted according to the fgv manufacturing industry installed capacity utilization reached in below february and in the seasonally adjusted below the previous having according to this a record low for the historical all use categories registered with highlights for the retraction in capital goods considering the industrial only food products and pharmaceuticals and veterinary products and among the negative it bears highlighting metallurgy and mechanics according to the same comparison market according to the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were eliminated in january employment decreased by in seasonally adjusted among economic manufacturing industry recorded the highest number of followed by the retail which eliminated thousand the services and the construction sectors increased employment level by and in seasonally adjusted in the last twelve months through employment increased led by the construction sector and followed by the retail sector and the services sector according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate reached of the economically active population in increasing the unemployment rate increased first increase according to this comparison basis since october in seasonally adjusted the unemployment reached in january up from in reflecting decreases of in occupation and in the occupation expanded by in january decelerating from the average growth observed last the pea expanded by

at in a increase delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate and individuals reached and compared to and in january net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in up from in the same month of environment the global macroeconomic scenario continues to reflect the deepening of the international financial with impacts over the global credit and economic in this recent economic data have pointed to the contraction in consumption and private worsening the loss of dynamism in international increasing unemployment rates and widening the product the weakness of aggregate demand in mature economies also began to contaminate the emerging economies that still showed some the current lack of liquidity conditions and further deterioration of growth prospects are set to be the most likely scenario for the short and medium which contributes for the global financial system to remain under severe as a result of the global recession energy and commodities prices have remained which resulted in significant reductions in inflation in the despite the slight rise at the the decrease in energy prices continued to contribute to the decline in which recorded in the last twelve months through down from in the twelve months through july in other mature the declines in are not less for the same inflation retreated to down from in to down from in the euro area and to down from in the uk this last between september and considering the deepening of credit the crisis in financial systems and the current behavior of central both in the mature economies and in the emerging economies were urged to increase the amount of resources injected into their financial systems and further the monetary policy easing in order to mitigate the risk of especially in mature economies and in such easing is also noticeable in latin where the central banks in brazil and peru have continued the cycle of interest rate it bears highlighting that in the united sweden and where interest rates are very close to central banks have begun considering or have already started to directly purchase public or private several measures of fiscal and monetary stimulus were edited or prorogated in order to reestablish the normality of private the housing market and the global financial for the us authorities have announced or launched loans programs for banks to encourage private consumption and activity of small which adds up to new plans adopted based both on fiscal stimulus and also on support to the financial trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in the first two months of in the exports reached and decreasing by and on a daily average total external trade recorded billion in a decrease on a daily average the decline of in exports and in imports in the first two months signal the cooling of global and domestic economic which exceeds initial creating concerns about the performance of total external trade for based on the liquidity international reserves totaled billion in recording a billion decrease under the cash international reserves totaled recording a billion decrease market and open market operations between the january copom meeting and the start of the future yield curve for tenures up to one year shifted sharply downward in the whole this behavior was domestically mainly driven by the released indicators signaling strong retraction in economic activity and weakening of labor as well as by the improvement of current inflation rates and the rates ended the period showing less intensive mainly influenced by the maintenance of uncertainty regarding the direction of global between january and march and rates decreased by bps and and rates decreased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation decreased to on march down from on january in its open market the bcb carried between january and march weekly and sevenmonth fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations reached of which billion were in the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of and working days on january of working days on february of working days on february and of working days on february these operations draw from the market the following billion and these operations averaged in the same the bcb borrowed money through overnight repo the bcb also conducted at the end of and liquidity management operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily in the period between january and march the bcb carried out traditional fx swap in which assumed a long position in domestic interest rate and a short position in these operations totaled rolling contracts due on february and march between january and march the national treasury raised a total of of which billion in billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in ntnfs maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in october and april and bought ltns maturing in april totaling and conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in september against the purchase of lfts maturing in march and june totaling the sales of settled in other national treasury securities maturing in and totaled the treasury also conducted purchase auctions of and totaling billion and ipca inflation reached in decelerating from in trailing inflation totaled accelerating relative to observed in in january under this the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which increased more rapidly than regulated in market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through compared to and in the twelve months through january despite the brl the prices of tradable goods reaching up from in january according to the same comparison regarding greatly pressured by the behavior in the prices of services and perishable inflation was even higher in this although inflation remained in line with the targets it is worth mentioning that the recent behavior of ipca inflation has been remarkably less benign than that observed in previous similarly to headline the three main core inflation measures calculated by the bcb reduced in january the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures reduced from and in december to and in on a trailing two of the three core inflation measures following the behavior of headline core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased to in january up from in the same month of last trimmed means core inflation also showed sharp acceleration against in january while the smoothed trimmed means core which tends to present more inertial contracted to in january down from in january still on a trailing inflation core which remain below the central showed relative stability in compared to standing at levels higher than the record lows reached in previous the general price index inflation retreated to in down from in but accelerated to in the last twelve up from in and in january in the twelve months through the increase reflected both the behavior of the consumer price indexbrazil which totaled in january and also of the price whose variation totaled in in january according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in january regarding agricultural inflation reached and in the twelve months through january and january on its industrial which showed less unfavorable behavior in the first half of also accelerated significantly in the last totaling in the last twelve months through january up from and in the last twelve months through january and january as highlighted in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output contracted in after eighteen consecutive months of still considering the seasonally adjusted after the reduction observed in december industrial output grew in despite relevant technical interruptions in the petrochemical it bears emphasizing that industrial output grew in up from in manufacturing industry production grew while mining industry production expanded by to and in in january industrial output grew evidencing important acceleration relative to the expansion recorded in december the data already released for point to the continuity of the industrial production expansion which will continue to be favored by several incentive factors that influence economic such as employment and credit the monetary easing already the fiscal impulse in some the recovery of reduced inventory among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital goods production remained stable in after contracting by in on the other the other use categories expanded in it bears highlighting the production of durable consumer which increased by in intermediate which expanded by in and and nondurable consumer which grew by in in it bears noticing the expansion of capital goods production in the followed by the growth of durable goods production in the the solid expansion of capital goods production in was mainly driven by the consolidation of positive for the continuity of domestic demand reflecting both the improvement of income and the expansion of underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability which should persist in on its the dynamism of durable consumer goods production the remarkable improvement in credit when compared to historical it should be highlighted that the appearance of signs pointing to consistent pressure over the availability of production as suggested in some industrial indicates that possible reductions in industrial activity expansion could be associated to productive capacity labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey retreated to in december record low for the series started in down from in november following the seasonal increased in january to below the rate observed in january the unemployment rate seasonally adjusted by the bcb decreased to in a record low for the historical down from in december and in it is worth emphasizing that the average unemployment rate totaled in down from in after increasing for four the purchase power of workers remained stable in january but increased by relative to january as a real payrolls expanded robustly by in january in up from in december constituting a key driver for sustained aggregate demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment grew in after remaining stable in totaling growth in while real payroll in the industrial sector expanded by still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment at the start of the with the creation of thousand jobs in a record high for the formal employment grew by in the seasonally observed data point to a expansion in formal employment in the highest rate recorded since june an evidence of strong dynamism in the labor manufacturing industry presented the highest hiring with the creation of thousand new followed by services sector and civil construction the retail following a seasonal recorded thousand but grew according to the seasonally adjusted in line with the positive developments in labor and with credit retail sales continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and signs of cooling cannot be according to data seasonally adjusted by the retail sales remained stable in after a expansion in retail sales increased by in november and in in retail sales grew by the greatest expansion since the steady growth of retail sales in the year reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit in in it should be highlighted the expansion in the sales of and domestic and clothing and amongst expanded retail which include the sales of parts and and the strong growth of the first group should be noticed for the next the continuity of the current expanding cycle is and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high sector for relative to automobile sales in january and february this corroborate this the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in december in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the a figure close to the record high of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the the nuci in the manufacturing industry reached close the record high observed in without the seasonal the nuci in december stood above the level registered in the same month of while the average installed capacity utilization rate in the year stood and above the observed in and the quarterly nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas reached in seasonally below the record registered in october but it still remains at a high above the historical it is important to emphasize that the january nuci results registered record highs for the series initiated in in three out of four categories surveyed by consumer capital goods and civil construction the monthly nuci calculated by without the seasonal reached in up from observed in the same month and registered record highs for capital goods and civil construction the reduction of idle in relation to the margins usually occurs in several despite the significant increase of in the absorption of capital goods increased firmly due to the vigorous growth of capital goods imports in as well as of capital goods production the production of civil construction inputs increased in the same showing robust in the absorption of capital goods continued to expand as a result of the increase in imports volume and in capital goods at the same time that the production of civil construction inputs increased recent data indicate although investment has been contributing to soften the trend of increasing capacity utilization it has not been sufficient to contain this in this the timely maturation of investment projects will be crucial to limit relevant mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand in the relevant forecast period for monetary as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust despite the expected deceleration at the in line with assessments present in inflation reports and previous copom minutes about important structural changes in the brazilian foreign the trade surplus reached billion in the last twelve months through february decrease exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and compared to the same period of as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust economic activity in the despite the high prices of several commodities included in the brazilian export the decrease in the trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through january equivalent to of regarding the external the process of economic deceleration in the us has as evidenced by the economic activity data in the last quarter of but uncertainties regarding its magnitude and duration still more recent data about the housing market and consumer goods as well as confidence indices and other leading point to a significant uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the us subprime mortgages market crisis over us and european financial institutions over credit conditions for households and despite the dominant opinion still seems to point out to a but possibly intense the negative assessments have become more this assessment to some uncertainties about the capacity of the monetary policy stance implemented by the central bank in the to which fiscal incentives will be to smooth in a timely manner the us economic in light of persistent difficulties in the financial such on their could be worsened by a cyclic deterioration in credit which would reinforce the trend to financial increasing the risk of intensifying the prospects for economic activity in despite some favorable indicators in germany and have also despite not provoking the same degree of concerns that surround the us economic on the other strong economic growth in main asian emerging which so far have been apparently little affected by the us mortgage have offset the effects of economic deceleration in mature in pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging many of which are in the midst of monetary tightening for mature prospects for monetary policy are more economies presenting more moderate inflationary pressures and more evident credit contraction tend to present additional monetary policy on the other in economies where inflation rates are above their respective the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more in this volatility and risk aversion indicators in international financial markets remained at quite high levels since the last copom affecting the behavior of brazilian assets until this brazilian economic activity does not seem to have been significantly impacted by the persistent deterioration on global financial markets despite not decoupled from external economic brazilian economy should sustain its growth essentially driven by domestic oil a systematic source of international increased substantially since the last copom and also continued highly this behavior in addition to structural changes in global energy recurrent geopolitical despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil the main scenario considered by the copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in apart from the trajectory of domestic gasoline one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts economy both through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of inflation the prices of other especially have also increased significantly since the last copom despite more pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and the turmoil on global financial there are some evidences that international investors are assuming positions in commodities to hedge against the risk of inflation assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the assumptions considered in the january copom projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices were both maintained at for compared to the assumptions considered in the january copom the projections for electricity price adjustments in were set at down from while projections for fixed telephone prices were maintained at the projection for regulated prices based on individual totaled in down from in the last copom this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total january the projection for regulated prices inflation in was set at up from considered in the last copom this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap estimates a spread in the fourth quarter of under the benchmark the swap rate trajectory points to a spread in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the target for the consolidated public sector primary surplus in and adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the january copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased to up from ahead inflation expectations decreased to down from considering the composition of monthly inflation market for inflation expectations increased to up from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca decreased compared to the value considered at the january copom but is still close to the target established by the cmn for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also decreased compared to the value considered at the january copom but is still above the central target for the the projection for based on both scenarios increased relative to the january copom and remained below the target for the benchmark scenario and above the target for the market monetary policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion continues quite and may even have accelerated since the beginning of and is at least for the inflationary pressures observed in the despite strong imports growth and the benign investment even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since the committee according to newly available that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflation on the other there are signs that relevant inflationary pressures are intensifying both in mature and emerging evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global the copom reaffirms the vision for the brazilian an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration represents an ambiguous risk on the one reducing net exports would act as a factor to restrain aggregate the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic on the other the alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two in the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets risk aversion could resulting in decreased demand for brazilian assets and depreciation of their in in the medium a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain brazilian although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets additional uncertainties surround the inflation and the risk of materialization of a less benign inflationary scenario the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last the copom considers that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory is because the heated demand and market of in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the committee understands that the prospects for this as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price depend mostly on inflation which remain carefully it is worth noticing that although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the for such as in the services in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as inflation expectations within the forecast discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longlasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the continuity of the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets for this to it is important that inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and do not point to persistent the committee once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and activity level has not completely mirrored the remaining effects of the interest rates cuts implemented in as well as the effects of the economic activity on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit growth and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the mentioned factors that will sustain the lagged remaining effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute on a significant way to this these issues become more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of and the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive this together with the external has helped to mitigate inflationary the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by fiscal transfers and the remaining impulse stemming from the monetary policy easing implemented until september continues to present risks to inflationary in this the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand is even more relevant to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and that is the reason why variables such as inflation the balance of risks associated to the scenario and especially the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so at the current characterized by the deterioration in the balance of inflationary prudence assumes an even more important role in this the copom evaluates in light of signals of economy heating and inflation expectations despite favorable the risks for the concretization of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the targets as reflected in the are even considering at the the maintenance of the basic interest rate is the most adequate the committee affirms that is ready to adopt a different monetary policy in the case of consolidation of a divergent scenario between projected inflation and the targets the copom also considers that the persistence of the mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand tends to increase the probability of such scenario to in this the copom analyzed the option of adjusting the selic target rate at this such adjustment would contribute to reinforce the anchoring of expectations not only for but also in the and to reduce the mismatch between aggregate demand and supply the prevailed understanding considered at this the balance of risks to the central prospective inflation path would justify the maintenance of the basic rate at its current the committee unanimously decided to maintain the selic target rate at without the committee will carefully monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until the next when it will define the next steps in its monetary policy under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its domestic demand continues to expand economic activity including sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already are still not fully on its the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary in light of robust domestic demand seems to become less at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority must remain vigilant to avoid that uncertainties contaminate longer time if the risk profile deteriorates in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective the committee will promptly adjust monetary policy stance to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on april for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september of data analyzed by the copom inflation inflation increased in compared to in january and in february education and food and beverages which increased and contributed both to the result in the market prices increased the same change recorded in with increases of in the prices of tradable goods and in the prices of regulated prices increased down from in the previous on a trailing the

inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation this risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies a both in magnitude and in increase in uncertainty and decline in on the other the increase in monetary policy the deterioration of the external or the frustration with the continuation of reforms may increase the risk premium and generate a expected path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary copom

reflect the impacts of the pandemic in the brazilian they should have little relevance to prospective the copom members continued the debate on the size of the economic given the available the copom concluded that the economy continued to recover gradually and close its in the current context of the measures of economic slack have become the committee understands that the available information is enough to demonstrate that the pandemic will have an extremely significant contractionary effect on global the fiscal and monetary measures adopted by the main economies tend to mitigate only a small share of these regarding emerging the outlook has quickly changed from favorable to as in other international the increase in risk aversion and the resulting reallocation of assets are causing a substantial tightening of financial the committee then discussed how the pandemic affects the brazilian economy the scenarios for prospective the value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom that there are three main transmission a supply derived from the interruption of production a production costs measured by the commodity price variation and important financial a shortage of derived from an increased uncertainty and the restrictions imposed by the thecommitteejudgesthatthefirsteffectwillhave small quantitative due to the brazilian poor interconnection with global production the second effect will probably imply a strong disinflationary impact in the short its importance should be put into perspective due to its temporary nature and to the volatility of commodity prices measured in local the third effect tends to be quite significant at the relevant horizon for monetary policy because the effects of the pandemic on activity could be according to simulations presented at the copom to offset this third it would be necessary to reduce the policy rate by more than percentage the copom conjectured on the structural interest rate and how it may evolve in the coming in the the possible interaction between the deterioration of the external the frustrations regarding the continuity of the reforms and the possible permanent changes in the public accounts adjustment may threaten the fall in structural interest rates observed in recent in light of this the committee considered that a reduction in the basic interest rate beyond percentage point could become counterproductive and could result in tighter financial thus leading to the opposite desired based on the information available so the committee sees the maintenance of the selic rate at its new level as the committee recognizes that new information on economic conditions will be essential to determine its next the copom members also discussed the effectiveness of monetary policy to stimulate they concluded although limited so the effects will become relevant for accelerating economic recovery when the restrictions imposed by the pandemic start to be the copom evaluated the balance of risks around the baseline the committee concluded at the the balance of risks has higher variance than in the the greater variance in the balance of risks does not necessarily imply gradualism in the conduct of monetary but that the magnitude monetary policy decisions is subject to greater monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate by percentage point to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant which includes the copom reiterates that economic conditions prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural the committee emphasizes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that questions about the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in a higher structural interest under such additional monetary easing may be counterproductive and result in tighter financial the copom understands that the current environment recommends caution in the conduct of monetary policy at this deems appropriate to keep the selic rate at its new the committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further economic data will be essential to determine its next the banco central do brasil stresses that it will continue to deploy its arsenal of exchange rate and financial stability policies to fight the current the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de

equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators in the horizon relevant for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging for most advanced the signs are of moderate particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements restraining investments and in the united some cooling in the dynamics of growth is although from relatively high levels of in the emerging the activity pace has been revised with highlight for the loss of strength in regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging despite the ongoing advances in the debate on the normalization of monetary the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced economies and relatively high in the emerging the price of the brent oil barrel fell to levels around since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have fallen while metal commodities prices have fallen on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through october of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the october copom among other this projection considers the hypothesis of changes of in the price of of in the price of bottled gas and of in electricity the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for higher than the valued considered at the october committee the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the trajectories of primary deficit set at of the gdp for and of primary surplus set at of the gdp for it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural result in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario considers the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the inflation projection compared to the value considered at the previous copom both for and for and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the inflation projections for and also increased relative to the value considered at the october and remain above the inflation for both the projections under the baseline and market scenarios stand around and above the midpoint policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the committee considers that the external environment remains with episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial for the the trend for global activity shows more moderation throughout the monetary policy relevant the prospects continue to indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition period of more moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and gdp growth rates have continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the this process has been intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of in investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of these and private consumption also shows contraction in line with recent data regarding employment and for the after a necessary period of which has been more intense and longer than the the activity expansion pace tends to as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain these coupled with other ones currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economic regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of agriculture and livestock have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them depends fundamentally on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance in addition to reducing uncertainties surrounding the domestic the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint even if more slowly and with lower intensity than previously the committee notes that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary as well as in its impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a negative perception regarding the macroeconomic environment and have negatively impacted inflation concerning inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong consumer credit has so over the last there on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by actions that were the committee considers as opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit in the as anticipated by previous the copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market has increased at a faster with data confirming the acceleration in the process of distension in this there is still the prevalence of a significant risk to the possibility of concession of high nominal with negative impacts over in spite of the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimates for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers over these relative prices ajustments in the among other have made the balance of risks to inflation in this as anticipated in previous these price adjustments caused inflation to rise in requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts over the committee reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the second order effects stemming from given the assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the copom considers that uncertainties surrounding the balance of risks mainly on the speed of the recovery process of fiscal results and its and that the relative price realignment process has been slower and more intense than the previously part of its members argued that it would be appropriate to the monetary in order to reduce the risks of of the inflation targeting regime most of the copom members considered monitoring the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to then define the next steps in its monetary policy the decided to maintain the selic rate at without by six votes in favor and two votes for raising the selic rate by the following members of the committee voted for maintaining the selic rate at alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz edson feltrim and otávio ribeiro the following members of the committee voted for raising the selic rate to sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its the net exports show better either by increasing benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and the depreciation of the or by the ongoing import substitution for the the combined effects of these the developments in the fiscal and quasi fiscal framework and in the assets in the dynamics of the regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by the in the committee emphasizes that there are uncertainties associated with the balance of mainly on the speed of the recovery process of fiscal results and on its and that the relative price realignment process has been slower and more intense than the previously in this the committee understands regardless of the outline of the other it will take the necessary measures in order to ensure the compliance with the objectives of the targeting that to bring inflation as close as possible to in circumscribing it to the limits established by the and to make inflation converge to the target in at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on january for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june update of the economic outlook and baseline recent data on economic activity suggest a possible resumption of the process of economic baseline scenario assumes that this recovery will occur at a gradual the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook has become owing to changes in monetary policy in major the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth various measures of underlying inflation are running at comfortable this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for and for this scenario among other a path for the selic rate that ends at and remains at that level until the end of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends at and at in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for in the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at conditional inflation projections for both and stand around in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may continue to produce prospective inflation on the other a possible frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case of reversal of the benign outlook for emerging the committee acknowledges that the balance of risks has evolved but risk still discussion about the conduct of monetary copom members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available information and they concluded that the data suggest the possibility of resumption of the process of economic which had been interrupted in recent the committee estimates that gross domestic product should remain stable or show asmall increase in the second with some acceleration expected for subsequent which will likely be reinforced by the stimuli provided by the release of fgts and notwithstanding this expected the baseline inflation scenario assumes that the pace of the underlying growth of the economy that excludes the effects of temporary stimuli will be committee members also assessed the evolution of indicators of financial conditions and concluded that there was significant easing in recent the committee attributes this movement basically to the expectations of adjustment in the degree of monetary policy to the benign evolution of financial conditions in global and to the prospects for improving the fundamentals of the brazilian the a result of the progress in the agenda of reforms and necessary adjustments in the this easing has been reflected in value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed during the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the june copom meeting central do copom prices and the dynamics of credit and capital copom members also discussed factors that could affect economic in the context of the deep adjustments that the brazilian economy notably those of fiscal they stressed that the persistence of uncertainties regarding fiscal sustainability tends to be in these uncertainties affect investment decisions that involve a high degree of irreversibility require greater predictability of future in a context of limited fiscal space for public they emphasized the importance of the continuation of the process of reforms and adjustments that contribute to the sustainability of fiscal by reducing fundamental uncertainties about the brazilian these reforms tend to stimulate private this potential expansionary effect to some offset the impact of current fiscal adjustments on economic as well as mitigate the risk of episodes of large risk premium as witnessed in the copom stressed the understanding that an acceleration of the pace of economic recovery to more robust levels will also depend on other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and development of the brazilian initiatives in the structural agenda of the banco central do brasil agenda contribute to this regarding the global the committee members considered that it evolved in a benign central banks of several economies some major economies included have provided additional monetary which contributed to easing global financial the copom judges that the risks associated with a slowing global economy remain and that economic policy and geopolitical uncertainties notably trade disputes and geopolitical tensions may contribute to even lower global given the risks still present in the external copom members once again highlighted the capability of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of anchored inflation and prospects of continuation of structural reforms and of resumption of economic the committee members discussed recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying the latter measures are deemed to be at comfortable in the horizon relevant to monetary which includes year the scenario with constant interest rates at leads to below target inflation for while the scenario with interest rate path extracted from the focus which embodies additional adjustment in the level of monetary projects inflation around committee members then discussed the since their previous of the factors highlighted in their balance of risks around the baseline inflation all members agreed that the balance of risks has evolved in they underlined the importance of concrete progress in the process of reforms and adjustments required by the brazilian which are fundamental for maintaining the benign environment for prospective with anchored the committee considers that the risk of a possible frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is still the main factor in its balance of copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at comfortable inflation projected around or below and high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate the committee members expressed the view that the current level of real interest rates provides stimulus to the the structural interest rate is a reference for the conduct of monetary when this policy yields a real interest rate below the structural it provides stimulus for economic activity and contributes to an increase in as the structural rate is not observable and economic activity and inflation depend on several other estimates of this rate involve a high degree of and are continually reassessed by the at each the copom assesses whether the selic rate is at an appropriate considering all factors that affect the evolution of inflation projections and the balance of and economic under the aforementioned this implies evaluating whether the degree of monetary stimulus is it is worth highlighting that the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation in the structural interest rate of the brazilian economy embodies two free structural rate and risk reforms and other changes to the economic environment may affect the structural rate in different depending on their effects on these two the component depends on the structural determinants of consumption and on the one and on the other through central do copom factors that persistently increase the willingness to invest push the structural interest rate these same factors may contribute to the reduction of the structural rate by lowering its risk premium if they imply an increase in the growth potential greater fiscal policy the pension by adapting retirement rules to the demographic structure and slows the pace of government spending increasing public in it generates incentives for the population to increase its savings rate to sustain a certain pattern of consumption after through these the reform contributes to reducing the component of the structural interest rate of the brazilian pension reform also reduces the risk premium component of the structural as the reform improves the prospects for fiscal the reform induces an increase in labor supply and tends to stimulate private investment by reducing uncertainties about fundamental aspects of the brazilian taking into account only the last two the reform would tend to increase the structural interest notwithstanding the complexity of the channels through which the pension reform may influence the structural interest rate of the brazilian when only its net effect is the copom understands that the reform contributes to the gradual decline of the structural interest rate of the copom reiterates its view that the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for the reduction of its structural interest for the full efficacy of monetary and for sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic in the committee judges that concrete progress in this agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its june meeting they unanimously decided to lower the selic rate to the copom also discussed the advisability of providing some perspective on possible monetary policy the committee decided to express its assessment that the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective inflation should permit additional adjustment of the degree of given the decision to clarify conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which best conveys the that guides its the copom deemed it essential to emphasize that the communication of this assessment does not constrain its next and to reiterate that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on in the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of

associated balance of and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes the copom reiterates that economic conditions

the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to the projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the committee considers that the external environment remains especially despite the occurrence of episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging the committee also identifies low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial for the global activity tends to grow more slowly throughout the monetary policy relevant recent prospects indicate modest activity recovery in the advanced while important emerging economies experience a transition in this of reduction in the activity it bears highlighting the growing concern regarding the chinese economy and its developments over the other still regarding international financial the copom highlights moderation in the dynamics of commodities despite some recent regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic gasoline international prices evolution tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy productive such as the it should be noted the increased uncertainties generated by low oil prices and their implications for sectoral companies and producing as well as for the financial markets in with risks to global financial the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that domestic absorption and gdp growth rates continue to indicating domestic activity expansion pace for this year lower than previously this process has been especially intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of in investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of these and private consumption also in line with employment and income for the after a necessary period of which has been more intense and longer than as and confidence the activity pace tends to the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the aggregate supply and demand consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and the investments tend to gain these coupled with other ones currently anticipate an aggregate demand composition growth in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the depreciation of the brl contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economic regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of agriculture and livestock the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance in addition to the reduction of uncertainties surrounding the domestic and international it is worth mentioning the importance of persevering in promoting structural reforms to ensure the fiscal consolidation in the longer the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers that the balance of the public sector stands in expansionary the committee hightlights that the lack of definitions and the significant changes in the trajectory of primary as well as in its impact the hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a negative perception regarding the macroeconomic besides negatively impacting the inflation concerning inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow the monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario considers credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong consumer credit has so over the last there on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by actions that have been the committee considers as opportune to continue to reinforce the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit in the as anticipated by previous the copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market is with data confirming the acceleration of the distension process in this a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of high nominal with negative impacts over in spite of the recent occurrence of real wage changes consistent with the estimates for the labor productivity the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the copom considers that the still elevated twelve month inflation level reflects the relative prices adjustment processes occurred in as well as the recovery process of the fiscal revenues observed at the federal and state at the start of the and that cause inflation to show although the committee recognizes that these processes have direct impact on it reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the effects stemming from the committee recognizes the progress in disinflation especially the containment of effects stemming from relative price it considers that the high level of inflation in twelve months and the inflation expectations distant of the objectives of the inflation targeting regime do not allow monetary policy the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz edson otávio ribeiro sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its net exports show better either by increasing benefited by the depreciation of the or by the ongoing import substitution for the the combined effects of these the developments in the fiscal and quasi fiscal framework and in the assets in this the dynamics of regulated the distension process in the labor market and an output gap more disinflationary than the initially anticipated are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by the in despite advances in the inflation the committee emphasizes that there are uncertainties associated with the balance of mainly on the recovery process of fiscal results and on its and that the relative price realignment process has taken longer and has been more intense than the the uncertainties regarding the behavior of the global economy in this the committee reaffirms that it will take the necessary measures in order to ensure the compliance with the objectives of the targeting which means to circumscribe inflation to the limits established by the in and to make inflation converge to the in in this it points out that the central scenario does not allow considering the hypothesis of monetary conditions at the end of the it was registered that the committee will reconvene on june for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june after increasing just in ipca inflation reached in this result was above market expectations on the eve of the disclosure of the but below expectations at the end of in the year through ipca inflation totaled slightly above the half of the result observed in the same period of last year trailing inflation reduced to in september down from in the lowest level for the series since june when the inflation target regime was the inflation acceleration in september was driven by the increase in both market prices increase compared to in and regulated prices increase compared to in among market tradable prices increased to in september up from in while prices increased to up from in the prices of services increased in september compared to in august and in september even with this a benign inflation scenario continues to evolve in line with the targets with favorable prospects for inflation in the coming ipca core inflation measures calculated by the central bank confirm this core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices reached in september to in and in smoothed trimmed means core showed low volatility in the reaching and in august and on the other after reaching in nonsmoothed trimmed means core was stable in august and increased in these three core measures continue to present downward trends on a trailing reaching and in compared to and in september on a trailing both the core by exclusion and the core inflation stood below the midpoint of the similarly to the headline on the other the smoothed core inflation has converged more slowly to the reaching in the last twelve months through down from in the last twelve months ended in in contrast with consumer price the general price index decelerated to in down from in average monthly inflation decelerated to in the third from in the second in the year through the increased compared to in the same period of last in the twelve months through the increased up from in the twelve months through the fall in september was mainly driven by accommodation in wholesale industrial price inflation and decelerating civil construction after presenting deflation in the threemonth period ended in the increased in recent reaching a monthly average of in the third and in agricultural ipa increased significantly in august and september each continuing the trend started in the previous two while industrial prices reached in august and were stable in with the rises in the last three the agricultural ipa inflation totaled in the twelve months through up from in august and in on the other the industrial ipa recorded in the twelve months through down from in wholesale price inflation may continue to positively influence consumer price inflation in the coming despite the increases in agricultural as emphasized in recent copom the continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation according to data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics industrial output recorded in on a seasonally adjusted the same as in reaching a new record evidences suggest that industrial activity performance in july was an isolated influenced by nonrecurrent as mentioned the previous copom minutes and the september inflation on a moving average industrial output slightly increased in very close to the record high registered in industrial production expanded in compared to the same month last after a increase in according to the same comparison in the year through industrial output expanded by compared to the same period last while industrial production reached it bears emphasizing that the industrial output result in august reached out of the activities with seasonally adjusted or of total on only of sectors grew on a basis between january and for leading and coincident indicators suggest industrial output in seasonally adjusted and increase on a moving average these results shall to a large expected negative performance in the automotive due to interruptions in the production observed during the month in the main several incentive such as the monetary easing implemented since september suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall continue in the coming disaggregated industrial data in august show that capital intermediate goods and consumer goods production increased by and compared to the same month last on a seasonally adjusted capital goods output increased in after expanding in in the year through the main drivers of industrial growth have been durable consumer goods production and capital goods production the expansion of durable goods production among other the recovery of real earnings and the expansion of the expansion of capital goods production is due to positive prospects for domestic and also to the influence of favorable international prices for some industrial the unemployment rate decreased to in down from in as against the reached in the same month last the average unemployment rate in the year through august increased compared to the same period last notwithstanding the expansion in labor force in the last twelve the number of employed people grew in the same indicating that the pace of jobs creation remains in the purchase power of workers increased a and compared to the same month last for a expansion in the year through in real payrolls increased in the same an important factor for the growth of aggregate according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment increased a seasonally adjusted in july and in compared to the same months last it reached in july and in growing for consecutive according to the ministry of labor and employment formal employment grew a seasonally adjusted in confirming the continuity of the ongoing in the last twelve it increased by the same observed in the year through mainly driven by the expansions of in civil construction and in the retail with the creation of jobs in august million in the last twelve formal job creation increased to after decreasing in june and ibge seasonally adjusted data recorded a seasonally adjusted robust growth in retail sales for compared to the same month last retail sales grew in in the year through retail sales expanded by mainly driven by furniture and domestic appliances sales and hypermarket sales the positive performance of retail sales is not restricted to and but also comprises retail sales expansion is expected to continue in the coming fostered by positive labor market and income credit expansion and the monetary easing as well as by the recovery in consumer installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry reached in july and in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the in the year through the average installed capacity utilization stood below the levels registered in the same period of although this difference has marginally july and august levels increased and compared to the same months last this decline partially reflects the improvements in the productive in recent data regarding output and absorption of capital goods suggest a robust ongoing expansion of in the year through the absorption of capital goods expanded by mainly driven by the increases in capital goods imports volume and in capital goods production civil construction inputs expanded by according to the same comparison despite the ongoing aggregate demand relevant aggregate supply unbalances are not anticipated in the coming as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust results in confirming previous copom assessments regarding important structural changes in the brazilian external in the year through the trade balance reached above the level reached in the same period last this result was driven by the record results of exports and imports trailing surplus through september reached a new record as a result of domestic demand imports have marginally recording a new record high according to the same comparison exports have also continued to reaching a new record high according to the same comparison as a robust external results are expected to continue in and the current account surplus stood at billion in reaching billion in the or of for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of regarding the international the uncertainties regarding the monetary policy stance in the us reduced in the last although additional increases cannot be the consensus points to the fact that the bulk of the domestic interest rates hike may have already on the other concerns about the fact that the monetary tightening cycle may have been excessive increased the fear of a recession in the us with potential implications for the brazilian it bears emphasizing the limited effects of the less favorable international outlook observed in the last when the concerns stated above were already especially with regard to the increased risk aversion and the lower international in after an in the sovereign risk reached historically low levels in the last this fact corroborates recurrent expressed in previous press releases and inflation that the brazilian economy is more resilient to external in this the copom reaffirms that the continued robust and persistent trade the buildup of international adequate public primary improved public debt profile and buyback of external debt have strengthened the domestic resilience to external the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external another concern regarding the international oil has also despite remaining at elevated nominal oil prices have reduced since the last copom oil prices still present high reflecting geopolitical among other the current scenario might reflect structural unbalances in the oil suggesting that permanent upward moves in oil prices have the future oil prices trajectory still encompasses great the scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in has become more likely to and the risks related to its materialization have decreased of inflation trends the inflation shocks ands their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the august copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in remained in and considering the same comparison the projections for fixed line telephone and household electricity adjustments in were changed to and from and the copom maintained the adjustment projection for all regulated prices in these according to the weights released by the represent of the total september the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to some regulated prices were projected considering the information the projection for the other regulated prices continue to be based on the endogenous determination this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the fourth quarter of reaching in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the august copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group fell to from this decrease was mainly driven by the incorporation of the inflation significantly below the projection presented in the august copom the ahead inflation expectations decreased to from for inflation expectations also decreased to from as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period decreased compared to the values considered at the august copom remaining below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting also remained below the values considered in august copom meeting and below the central target for the the projections for according to both also remained below the august remaining below the target in the benchmark scenario and above the target in the market monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that monetary policy has both contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic the economic activity data still suggest expansion in line with the supply conditions in the next with low likelihood of significant pressure over imports expansion has contributed significantly to this complementing domestic production therefore restricting potential inflationary effects of domestic demand despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international due to the interest rates increase in industrialized the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external even taking into account that part of the favorable results for the inflation tends to revert in the the scenario for the inflation trajectory remains as in the august the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of anticipated favorable the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation the copom emphasizes that there are important lags in monetary policy transmission to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has been reduced by with the greater part of the reduction concentrated in the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the recent activity resumption on inflation have not completely during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in the august copom activity level should also reflect the effects of the new minimum wage and the fiscal impulse occurred since the last quarter of the effects of interest rates cuts will add up to other factors that will contribute to demand given the reasons stated the copom considered the convenience to reduce the selic rate by basis despite considering that several factors would justify such and that such decision would contribute to increase the magnitude of the total adjustment to be the copom members concluded at the present a reduction in the selic rate would be a better response of the current monetary conditions to the significantly improved inflation outlook observed between the august and october in light of this the copom unanimously decided to continue the monetary policy easing process begun in the september meeting and reduce the selic rate target to without and monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until the next at which time it will define the next steps in its monetary policy given the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission mechanisms and the lower distance between the current selic rate and the interest the copom understood that the maintenance of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real may demand a more cautious monetary easing this argument is even more relevant in light of the fact that the monetary policy decisions in the coming months will produce concentrated impacts for under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the main variables that determine price despite the decrease in international financial markets some factors that caused heightened volatility in previous months still in such an the monetary authority must remain vigilant so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time in case of an exacerbation of the risk factors monitored by the the monetary policy strategy will be promptly adapted to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on november for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased in up from in the previous four out of the nine surveyed groups presented negative household items communication transportation and education with the prices of food and beverages increased in the mainly driven by the increase in the prices of meat and personal outlays were the main driver of the september mainly because of the prices of household which increased this item was the main individual driver of the ipca inflation in contributing the ipca rose by in the year through september and in the last twelve regulated prices grew in september and in the last twelve while market prices increased by and in the same amongst market tradable prices increased while prices rose on a trailing tradable and nontradable prices increased and the increased in for cumulative changes of in the year and in the last twelve the ipa prices the with the largest weight in the decelerated in recording down from in for cumulative changes of in the year through september and in the last twelve the grew in the up from in reflecting the increases in the prices of meat and water and sewage the incc decelerated in posting down from in reflecting the reduced impact of wage adjustments in civil construction and lower increase in the prices of services and the deceleration in wholesale price inflation in september was driven by lower changes in industrial the industrial ipa remained after recording in mainly due to the decrease in the prices of moisturized alcohol and mining which outweighed the increases in the prices of tobacco and among the agricultural ipa reached in stable relative to reflecting the fall in the prices of beans and sugar cane and increases in the prices of fruit and according to the processing stages of only final goods recorded price reduction the prices of intermediate goods increased while the prices of raw materials grew in after posting and in all ipca core inflation measures increased in but sustained their declining trend on a twelvemonth trailing the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at in totaling in twelve the trimmed means core reached in decreasing to in twelve the core excluding household food and monitored prices totaled reaching in the last twelve the core calculated by the fgv under the symmetric trimmed means reached in totaling in the year through september and in the last twelve the ipca diffusion index the number of items in the ipca registering price stood at in up from in activity according to monthly retail sales increased a seasonally adjusted in the four activities with seasonally adjusted data with highlights to the increases observed in furniture and home appliances retail sales increased compared to august of totaling in the year through august and in the last twelve são paulo trade association seasonally adjusted by banco central do showed a decline for retail sales in são paulo in consultations to the usecheque system decreased while database consultations for credit sales declined by in the year through these indicators expanded by and compared to the same period of regarding investment capital goods production increased a seasonally adjusted in the civil construction inputs production and capital goods imports decreased by and according to the same comparison in the year through these indicators rose by and compared to the same period of capital goods production for energy increased for for mixed while capital goods production for agriculture fell in the same for industrial capital goods production increased below average partially reflecting the high increase in capital goods imports in the same according to monthly industrial production increased a seasonally adjusted in a new record mining industry decreased by while manufacturing industry grew by according to the same comparison in the year through industrial output expanded by compared to the same period of with manufacturing and mining industries growing by and regarding use on a seasonally adjusted capital intermediate and durable consumer goods production increased by and in while and consumer goods production fell by in the year through compared to the same period of production in all use categories with highlights to the increases in durable consumer goods and capital goods totaling and seasonally adjusted data for industrial production showed increases in of the sectors mainly in transportation and chemical which increased and and and and leather both with a expansion in sustained positive changes for the second consecutive after previous in the year through august both still show negative with and cni manufacturing data showed stability in hours worked in production and a decrease in real industrial sales in on a seasonally adjusted in the year through both indicators also showed distinguished as hours worked increased by while real sales fell compared to the same period of installed capacity utilization reached a seasonally adjusted in below the previous month without seasonal installed capacity utilization leveled at above the august in automobile production decreased a seasonally adjusted partially reflecting interruptions in the production observed in some domestic sales grew while external sales decreased by according to the same comparison in the year through automobile production and domestic sales expanded by and while external sales decreased by compared to the same period of last and expectations the survey showed a elevation in consumer confidence in both icc components current economic conditions index rose while the consumer expectation index increased by the icc expanded by compared to september according to the the iec increased a in and compared to the same month of last according to the fgv which encompassed homes in the seven main capitals of the the icc increased a in recording stability in the present situation assessment and a improvement in the ahead the national confidence index measured by ipsos in brazilian recorded a increase in and a compared to september market according to the ministry of labor and new jobs were created in spread among all major activity on a seasonally adjusted formal employment increased with highlight to the expansion in civil in the year through thousand new jobs were compared to thousand jobs created in the same period of according to the ibge survey in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in down from in standing above the observed in august in the year through the average unemployment rate stood at above the level registered in the same period of such increase may be explained by the increase in job stimulated by improved conditions in the labor a typical phenomenon registered at the current stage of economic another positive aspect highlighted by the pme is the improved quality of private sector job with the increase of formally hired real average earnings reached in increasing a and relative to the same month of last real payrolls increased a and relative to the same month last in the year through these two indicators grew and according to the amount of employed people increased in august in the industrial seasonally totaling a growth in the and delinquency rates used as reference for interest grew in september and in the last twelve credit for individuals grew by in the month and in twelve corporate credit operations with domestic funding increased in the month and in the last twelve while externally funded operations increased in the month and in twelve leasing operations with individuals increased while those with corporates totaled in the year through the average interest rate on credit declined again in reaching below the september the average rate on credit for individuals decreased to compared to in the same month of while the average rate on corporate credit decreased to in the same delinquency rates in the financial system in arrears for more than ninety stood at in delinquency rates for corporate credit operations reached while for credit operations with individuals stood at net delinquency rates for retail measured by the fell to in in the year through new registers and cancelled registers increased while the average default rate reached up from in the same period of environment the external outlook remains as a result of the robust growth in china and the relative high growth rates in europe and the rest of in the evidences do not indicate sharp deceleration in economic the deceleration in the real estate market happens at a measured pace and the american banking system is the economy is still underpinned by expenditures and corporate investments recent declarations of fed authorities point to inflation whose exacerbation could trigger inflationary in the euro inflation should trend upwards in the despite the recent decline of international oil prices below as a result of pressures over prices in the euro area and the economic activity fostered by domestic demand and the european central bank is likely to maintain the monetary tightening in economic output and prices have grown at a moderate since deflation has economic expansion is expected to continue in the fourth the next decisions of the bank of japan will depend on activity and prices expectations and the weight the boj attributes to each of these high oil oil reduced risk of hurricanes and the relief of geopolitical concerns have driven the recent decline of oil although the risks remain in the coming the reduced refinement capacity and an eventual rough winter in the north in addition to geopolitical may cause oil prices these together with the recent announcement made by the organization of petroleum exporting countries of a daily output cut as of the end of october indicate that oil prices should increase in the trade and international reserves in brazilian external trade confirmed the ongoing total external trade reached and the trade surplus totaled in the year through all trade measures reached record exports and

drivers were raw oil and iron ore totaling respective increases of and over september daily average among the there was a noticeable increase in raw sugar exports totaling a increase over the september manufactured exports were driven by external sales of vehicles and planes with respective increases of and according to the same comparison export volumes increased for all export especially manufactured goods with low share in total and confirm the export diversification process and broadening of exports imports totaled billion in with a daily average of a increase over the same month of all import categories measured in daily consumer goods with highlights to vehicles raw materials and intermediate goods fuel and lubricants and capital goods at the end of international reserves totaled a billion increase in the money market and open market operations after the august copom the yield curve shifted downward for all the fall in the long end of the yield curve was mainly driven by the benign current inflation falling inflation expectations and the release of economic activity this downward move was interrupted only from september to september when the concerns regarding the deceleration pace of the economy and the political outlook in some emerging countries as these risk factors the futures interest rates recovered their declining also driven by the brl appreciation and the brazilian country risk from august to october and rates fell and and rates fell and real interest rates measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectations declined to on october from on august on september and september the bcb conducted reverse exchange rate swap in which the bcb assumed a long fx position and a short

these operations totaled the treasury conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in and totaling and bought lft maturing in the treasury also conducted auctions to purchase ltns maturing on january and of several amounting billion and monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index rose to in september in as a trailing inflation reached compared to in september market prices changed in the twelve months through september in september and regulated in september among market the prices of tradable goods increased in the twelve months through september in september and the prices of in september the prices of food and beverages impacted by domestic and external increased by in september in september and reached in twelve the prices of services rose in september in and in twelve months in september in services inflation still remains at high levels and there are localized pressures in the food and beverages the average of the underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb has moved from in august to in on its on a trailing the average change of the five core inflation measures moved from in august to in the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation moved from in august to in and the trimmed means core inflation changed from to in the same the double weight core inflation increased from in august to in at the same core inflation by which excludes ten household food and fuels increased from in august to in and the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household food changed from in august to in broadest measured by the general price index decreased from in august to in on a trailing in inflation in september the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in the twelve months through influenced by strong increase in the agricultural sector impacted by supply according to the breakdown by stage of there were increases in the prices of raw materials intermediate goods and final goods according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the stood at in the twelve months through september in september the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed according to the same comparison driven by the increase in labor on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in august in and in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the increased by in after registering an increase of in as a the indicator increased in the quarter ended in and increased the accumulated growth remained stable at in on its the consumer confidence index from getúlio vargas foundation increased in september after four consecutive with improvement on both the perception of the current economic conditions and the the services sector confidence index after five consecutive influenced by the evident improvements in the market the indicators of credit constructed by the central bank based on quarterly consultation held with representative institutions of each credit market in more flexible conditions in the fourth quarter of compared to the specifically about the credit to legal entities companies and small and the analysis suggests a scenario moderately more when it comes to approving new credit related to consumer the expectation for the fourth quarter indicates slight recovery in the percentage of credit for housing despite the demand at levels higher than those observed from july to september the expected approval of new lines tends to be similar to the previous the brazilian institute of geography and statistics released information on gross domestic product for the second quarter of the expansion of activity was and over the first quarter of according to seasonally adjusted the cumulative growth rate in four quarters fell from to confirming the view that the economy has grown below its from the aggregate supply the service sector and agriculture grew and compared to the and industrial production fell by according to the same comparison from the aggregate demand household expanded by and government consumption increased by while gross fixed capital formation contracted by on its the contribution of the external sector was with a decrease of in exports and expansion of in in foreign sales to argentina and to the european union were negatively in domestic driven by moderate expansion of credit and by employment and income has been the main factor sustaining industrial activity registered the third positive monthly growth in according to the series seasonally adjusted by the industrial production rose in after an increase of in production grew in of the branches of industrial production fell in august and on a accumulated under the quarterly moving average industrial production increased from june to regarding revenues in the manufacturing there was real growth of in despite a decline in the number

increased compared to august data released by the ministry of labor and employment show in thousand formal jobs were created thousand in august the sectors that contributed the most to this increase in the number of formal jobs in the in absolute were the services and trade in the set of available data indicates although the labor market remains there are signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey from broad retail sales increased in in by fiscal according to the seasonally adjusted broad retail sales decreased in after expansion of in the accumulated growth rate in twelve months stood at in with expansion in all ten sectors with highlights for computer and communication material and equipment and furniture and appliances since october the in partnership with the has released the trade confidence index this indicator provides the current outlook and signals the evolution of commercial activity in a more timely in the index expanded for the second consecutive for the upcoming the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll by the reduction in borrowing costs and by moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal rose in september standing above the level observed in september according to the seasonally adjusted series calculated by the the nuci stood at in september the highest value since july above the level recorded in september and below the record high of the series recorded in june capacity utilization intensified in the consumer goods which reached and retreated in the capital goods which recorded in the of intermediate goods and construction the levels stood at and still according to the the industry confidence index continues a gradual recovery reaching the highest level since july according to the seasonally adjusted mainly due to improvements in the expectations the share of companies that reported inventories at normal levels increased since the last copom the trade balance on a accumulated basis continued a downward dropping to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in associated to changes of and compared to the previous twelve as a the current account deficit in the same period reached billion in equivalent to of while foreign direct investment totaled billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of surpassing the need for external global economy faces a period of with prospects of low growth for a prolonged despite the high risk the volatility and risk aversion since the last copom partly influenced by unconventional monetary policy actions in major mature high unemployment rates for a long coupled with the implementation of fiscal the limited space for countercyclical actions and political uncertainties are translated into projections of low growth for mature the compound leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development related to indicates even greater moderation in the growth of the main in the same the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for september suggest moderate global activity despite some improvement at the margin in the united states highlighting the slowdown in the manufacturing regarding monetary advanced economies persist with strongly accommodative unconventional measures announced by mature economies should increase liquidity in their respective as well as commodities in the short core inflation measures have remained at moderate levels in the in the euro area and in in emerging in the monetary policy bias is which in some with additional countercyclical the price of brent oil barrel has maintained above it bears highlighting that the even higher geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom international prices of metallic and agricultural commodities have changed and relative to the record highs observed in april the changes reach and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a fall of until compared to the peak recorded in february in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was influenced by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in fx it is plausible to affirm that the reduction of growth targets in china and coupled with the fragility of the global tends to generate downward pressures over commodities prices in the medium assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for for were maintained at the same value considered at the august copom the projected adjustments for bottled gas for were maintained at the same value considered at the august copom the projected adjustments for for fixed telephone tariffs were reduced from which was considered at the last to and the projected adjustments for electricity remained at unchanged relative to the august copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was maintained at considered at the august copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in reduced to from considered at the august copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price it is worth mentioning in large the retreat in the projection for is due to the estimated reduction in electricity the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus around of it is as a working a primary surplus around of gdp for without according to parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for it is as a working a primary surplus of of without the set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last the main scenario does not include the occurrence of extreme events in international financial but considers the estimates of the impacts caused by changes in the external environment on the brazilian in it incorporates the estimated effect of the recent supply shock in agricultural since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations decreased from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed to and from and for the median changed to and from and in the same the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation remained stable relative to the figure considered at the august copom meeting and stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for remained standing above the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection decreased in both but still stands above the midpoint target in both for the third quarter of the inflation forecast is above the midpoint inflation target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investments and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those deriving from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic the committee understands the prospects of moderate global activity have remained and the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed it also notes in these there seems to be limited leeway for monetary policy and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming in important emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity remained on the other since the penultimate there were evidences of localized pricing stemming from an unfavorable supply shock in agricultural for the this shock tends to be less intense and less lasting than the one observed in as well as it tends to reverse in the medium despite manifesting inflationary bias in the short the international scenario looks disinflationary in the medium for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among moderation of total moderation in investment flows and tighter credit another transmission channel of great importance is the impact over businessmen the copom evaluates that prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are with some asymmetry among the several this assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the fact that to a lesser confidence stands at high levels and in an upward the committee that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months tends to move towards the targets even in a the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the committee also highlights risks stemming from the instability in the prices of in natura products and which for in the dynamics of wholesale the committee highlights that the main scenario encompasses more intense pace of activity in this semester and next the committee identifies decrease in the probability of extreme events in international financial at the same it argues that the external environment remains given the lack of a final solution for the european financial and the risks associated to the ongoing deleveraging process of households and government in the main economic it also notes that the scenario for the main emerging economies appears more challenging than although the inflation prospective scenario has been negatively impacted by supply shocks related to domestic and foreign climatic events in the short it maintained favorable signs for longer the committee also notes according to the main scenario inflation tends to move towards the target in this the copom decided to reduce the selic rate to without with five votes for the monetary policy action and three votes in favor of maintaining the selic rate at the following members of the committee voted for the reduction of the selic rate to alexandre antonio aldo luiz altamir luiz awazu pereira da silva and luiz edson the majority of the committee members in that the remaining uncertainties about the pace of economic largely due to the prospects that the period of weakness in the global economy will be more prolonged than will have disinflationary impact on the domestic it was highlighted that the recent price pressures stem mainly from supply both domestic and which tend to reverse in the medium according to these five members of the the prospective scenario for inflation justified a final adjustment in monetary the following members of the committee voted for the maintenance of the selic rate at anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos araújo and sidnei corrêa in this the minority of the copom members argued that the activity recovery tends to be supported by fiscal and credit impulses already introduced in the demand and cost pressures may have impact on according to the view of these three members of the the prospective scenario for inflation would not recommend a further adjustment in monetary the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially regarding household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and for the these the programs of public services concession and the gradual recovery of confidence create good prospects for investment in this and in the upcoming the committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector moving from a position of neutrality to on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario represents an important factor restraining aggregate these elements and quasi fiscal developments are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that the brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the of the financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral according to the are largely permanent in light of the considering the balance of risks to the recovery in domestic activity and the complexity involved in the international the committee believes that the stability of monetary conditions for a sufficiently long period of time is the most appropriate strategy to ensure the convergence of inflation toward the even in a at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on november for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in up from in totaling in the year and in twelve compared to in the twelve months through according to data released by the the

agricultural commodities showed variations in opposite with declines in the international prices of grains and increases in sugar and coffee the price of a barrel of brent crude despite declined during the analyzed in the annual change in the cpi for the advanced data from the international financial statistics from increased to up from in due to the behavior of energy interrupting the

the year through the trade surplus totaled down from billion in the same period of reflecting retreat of in exports and in according to the daily average total external trade declined in the according to the daily average totaling international reserves reached billion in increasing billion and billion in the there were no interventions in the domestic exchange rate spot market and open market operations after the august copom the domestic yield curve showed decline in its entire the drop in interest rates was influenced by the release of data regarding formal employment and economic activity below market estimates and by expectations of continued monetary easing on the international concerns about the developments of the crisis in the euro area and the prospect of low global growth strengthened the downward movement of between august and october and interest rates fell by and the rates for maturities of two and three years declined and the real interest measured by the ratio between the nominal interest rate and the inflation expectation for the next twelve decreased from on august to on october mainly due to the reduction in nominal between august and october the bcb carried out reverse fx swap auctions maturing in november and december and january in an amount equivalent to the net balance of bcb swap operations is long in fx in its open market the bcb carried out from august to october repo operations borrowing billion for a the average daily balance of the long term operations increased from between july and august to billion between august and october in the same the bcb also borrowed money through very short term repo operations with tenures between thirteen and working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also conducted very operations through borrowing and carried out leveling at the end of the with tenures of one and two working the average daily balance of these operations totaled billion in the the average daily balance of the total outstanding of repurchase agreements of the bcb increased from between july and august to between august and october considering the operations for the most recent the total outstanding of repurchase agreements increased from billion on august to billion on october the main factors that contributed to the expansion of liquidity in the period were the net expenditures of the union and the release of funds from compulsory between august and october the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached of which billion in ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and the sales of lfts totaled with the issuance of securities maturing in in auctions of securities maturing in and were totaling regarding the global the pandemic keeps causing the largest economic downturn since the great against this despite some promising signs of recovery in major and some moderation in financial assets the environment for emerging economies remains turning to the brazilian economic recent indicators suggest a partial sectors more directly affected by social distancing measures remain depressed despite the offsetting effects of the government transfer uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than especially for the period starting at the end of this concurrently with the expected winding up of the emergency transfer various measures of underlying inflation remain below the level compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and inflation seems to be cooling after sharp relative to the previous copom projections remain relatively revisions to some components of service price inflation have offset the impact of the depreciation of the brazilian real and the rise in commodity the inflation projections in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and constant exchange rate at stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at rises to in and in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and constant exchange rate at yields inflation projections around for for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for risks around the baseline inflation the committee emphasizes that risks to its baseline scenario remain in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation this risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary on the other fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or frustrations regarding the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a decline in aggregate introducing an asymmetry to the balance of this set of factors could potentially result in a path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the data already available for the gdp did not but it showed that the depth of the current economic downturn is only comparable to that of the great there are some promising signs of recovery has shown to be the strong recovery in consumption was not followed by the services the committee pondered that the main restriction to a full recovery in the major economies is the evolution of the pandemic and the possibility of a second wave of the virus is a major the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they evaluated that recent data suggest a partial recovery of the economic government transfer programs have allowed for a relatively strong resumption of durable goods consumption and even of several service sector especially those most directly affected by social distancing remain quite looking the poor predictability associated with the evolution of the pandemic and the necessary decline in emergency aid by the end of increase uncertainty about the speed of the economic the committee considered that this unpredictability and the risks associated with the evolution of the pandemic may imply a domestic scenario characterized by an even more gradual recovery of the the copom members debated on the level of economic as with the the committee believes that the pandemic should continue to have heterogeneous effects on the economic given the nature of the the service sector should continue to have a larger economic slack than other the committee concluded that the nature of the crisis probably implies that the disinflationary pressures from reduced demand may last longer than in previous the committee then assessed the appropriate degree of stimulus for the current it analyzed whether the existence of an asymmetry in its balance of mainly related to fiscal issues and the continuation of reforms in the brazilian would be a sufficient reason to maintain the stimulus at its current given its perception of economic slack and prospective the committee considered although its projections for inflation are below the target for the relevant horizon for monetary in line with its inflation targeting the committee concluded that it would be appropriate to increase residually the degree of monetary the committee then resumed discussion of a potential effective lower limit for the brazilian policy interest rate and its connection with prudential and financial stability for the majority of the members of the this limit would be significantly higher among emerging economies than among developed countries due to the existence of a risk this premium is dynamic and tends to be larger in given the relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal in this we would already be close to the level from which further interest rate reductions could be accompanied by asset price the copom also discussed the relative importance of the main components of credit and operating costs of the financial considering the long history of the brazilian economy operating with the basic interest rate at a very high the unprecedented low interest rates may compromise the performance of some markets and economic with potential impact on financial based on results from stress test the committee considers that the financial system is resilient to the credit risk arising from the current when analyzing the financial system in a broad way considering its various products and financial services the committee reflected that an unprecedentedly low interest rate environment may generate increased asset price without the necessary time to transition to a new it may affect the proper functioning and dynamics of the financial system and the capital the committee concluded that possible new interest rates reductions would demand caution and additional to this if further interest rate cuts would require greater clarity about prospective inflation and activity and could be spaced over in order to provide the monetary stimulus deemed adequate to meet the inflation but maintaining the necessary caution for prudential the copom considered the use of a forward guidance as an additional monetary policy the copom discussed the limitations on the use of this instrument in emerging relative to developed emerging countries are more susceptible to contagion from external crises and have greater vulnerabilities in their economic due this greater unpredictability and the use of such an instrument becomes more the committee concluded that despite those the forward guidance would be the policy strategy with the best the forward guidance transmits the vision on its future actions and tends to adjust the expectations reflected on the intermediary part of the yield to adapt the forward guidance to the dynamic limits imposed by prudential the committee considered that it should have an asymmetric policy in if the necessary conditions were the copom would not raise the interest rate but could reduce to maximize its the committee decided that this forward guidance should be conditional on inflation as well as on the inflation projections of its baseline for the relevant monetary policy which currently includes to a lesser this information on inflation would be considered altogether when they were sufficiently close to the inflation target for the corresponding they would indicate the end of the given the difficulties inherent in using forward guidance in emerging in addition to expectations and projections of inflation in the relevant the committee also deemed necessary to condition its interest rate policy intention on two other it is conditional on the maintenance of the fiscal since its rupture would imply significant changes to the structural interest rate of the it is conditional on the anchoring of inflation given that an unanchoring would indicate that the costs derived from the monetary stimulus would be outweighing its monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate by percentage point to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes to a lesser the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the copom believes that the current economic conditions continue to recommend an unusually strong monetary stimulus but it recognizes due to prudential and financial stability the remaining space for monetary policy if it should be possible future adjustments to the current degree of monetary stimulus would occur with additional gradualism and would depend on the perception of the fiscal as well as on new information that changes the current assessment about prospective despite the asymmetry on its balance of the copom does not foresee reductions in the monetary stimulus unless inflation as well as its baseline scenario inflation are sufficiently close to the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary which currently includes to a lesser this intention is conditional on the maintenance of the current fiscal regime and on the anchoring of inflation following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the advancement of the immunization programs should promote a more robust economic recovery throughout the economic slack and central bank communication from major economies suggest monetary stimuli will last market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies could result in a more challenging environment for emerging turning to the brazilian recent indicators are evolving better than expected in spite of the second wave of the pandemic being more intense than uncertainty about economic growth still remains larger than usual but should gradually return to its normal the various measures of underlying inflation are at the top of the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and with the exception of commodity prices continued to impacting food and industry price the transition to higher energy prices related to the electricity tariff flag system should keep inflation under pressure in the short the committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are temporary but continues to closely monitor its the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic recovery from the pandemic can be slower than producing a prospective inflation on the other further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravate the fiscal or a frustration with the continuation of the reform may add pressure to the risk the relative increase of the risks of these events implies an upward asymmetry to the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the committee assessed that the progress in the implementation of immunization the new fiscal stimuli in some developed and the communication by central banks of major economies that monetary stimuli will be should imply robust economic growth during the the discussion about in particular about the risk of a lasting inflation increase in the united could result in a more challenging environment for emerging the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they considered despite the intensity of the second wave of the the latest available economic activity data have surprised for the the second half of the year should bring a robust as the effects of the vaccine rollout are felt more the copom members then debated the level of economic although the economic slack as a whole is returning to the late level in the coming the committee considered that the pandemic produced heterogeneous effects across economic whereas the goods sector operates with low the service sector is struggling to the copom judges that economic activity and formal labor market data suggest that the overall slack has declined faster than despite the increase in the unemployment the copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus inflation projections are slightly below the target for the committee pondered that fiscal risks remain implying an upward bias in these this asymmetry in the balance of risks affects the appropriate degree of monetary therefore justifying a increase in the interest rate in this the copom then evaluated different normalization paths for the selic considering the baseline scenario and the balance of the committee deemed appropriate another adjustment of the same magnitude in the next unless inflation determinants the committee noted that subsequent uninterrupted increases in the interest rate up to the level considered neutral imply projections considerably below the inflation target at the relevant the copom reinforced that its views for the next meeting may be altered if there is a change in inflation projections or in the balance of since the decision will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and the inflation projections and the committee then discussed the communication of monetary policy in the reference to a of the interest the committee members pointed out that reflects their opinions on the appropriate monetary policy for the convergence of inflation to target over the relevant the copom understands that the reference to as well as the disclosure of the implicit neutral rate and the output gap in the models used by the increases the transparency of the central reaction function improves monetary policy the copom reevaluates its scenario at every meeting committed to the convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant monetary policy considering the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes without compromising its fundamental objective of price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full at this the baseline scenario indicates that a partial normalization of the policy rate remains appropriate to keep some degree of monetary stimulus during the economic the committee emphasizes that there is no commitment with this and that future steps of monetary policy could be adjusted to assure the achievement of the inflation for the next meeting the committee foresees the continuation of the partial normalization process with another adjustment of the same magnitude in the degree of monetary the copom emphasizes that its view will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro damaso and paulo neves de ipca inflation increased in up from in and accelerated to in totaling in the compared to in the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which increased more rapidly than regulated prices in a reversal in the dynamics observed in the recent in market prices and regulated prices increased in the compared to and in despite the brl appreciation in the prices of tradable goods reaching up from in amongst market pressured by the behavior in the prices of services and perishable goods inflation was even totaling the highest rate recorded since although inflation at the end of in line with the targets it is worth mentioning that the recent behavior of ipca inflation has been remarkably less benign than that observed in previous similarly to headline the three ipca core inflation measures trended upwards in the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices and smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures changed from and in october to and in november and and in it bears emphasizing that headline inflation acceleration in was followed by two of the three core inflation core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased significantly in against in trimmed means core inflation also showed sharp acceleration against in while the smoothed trimmed means core which tends to present more inertial continued to retreat against in on a trailing despite remaining below the central all inflation core measures accelerated in compared to standing at levels remarkably higher than the record lows reached in previous the general price index inflation rallied in the last quarter of increasing from in october to in november and in as a inflation increased in up from in and in the increase reflects both the behavior of the consumer price which totaled in from in and also of the price whose variation totaled in up from in according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in regarding agricultural prices reached in in and in on its industrial which had been showing less unfavorable behavior until last also accelerated significantly in the last totaling in up from in as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output grew in the seventeenth consecutive expansion according to this comparison an evidence of the solid performance of industrial still considering the seasonally adjusted after the robust increase observed in industrial output retreated in due to reduced working on a trailing industrial output grew and in the year through on its manufacturing industry production reached in the last twelve months through november in while mining industry production expanded by in for the effects of celebrations can result in a new retreat in the industrial the trend for the start of points to the continuity of the industrial production expansion which will continue to be favored by the several incentive factors that influence economic such as employment and credit the monetary easing already the fiscal impulse in some the recovery of reduced inventory among the use the production of capital goods increased by in while both the production of intermediate and consumer goods decreased by in according to data seasonally adjusted by the after increasing in october and in it bears emphasizing the expansion of capital goods production expanding by in the year through followed by the growth of durable goods production growing by in the year through the solid expansion of capital goods production to a large due to the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of domestic demand which has reflected both the improvement of income and the expansion of underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability on its the dynamism of durable consumer goods production the remarkable improvement in credit when compared to historical it should be highlighted that the emergency of signs pointing to consistent pressure over the availability of production as suggested in some industrial that possible reductions in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be associated to productive capacity labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey maintained a downward trend and reached in down from in october and in november the unemployment rate seasonally adjusted by the bcb also down from in it is worth noticing that the unemployment rate in november reached a record low for the started in march both for the observed and for seasonally adjusted as a the average unemployment rate reached in the year through down from in the same period of the purchase power of workers recovered in november for the third consecutive month and expanded by and as a real payrolls expanded by in the year through a key driver for sustained aggregate demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment remained stable in after expanding by in october and compared to november on its data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment in even after the thousand jobs reduction in in line with the seasonal the expansion of million jobs in the year represented a growth in job a new record high for the series started in in thousand new jobs were created in the services sector and thousand new jobs were created in the retail sector both representing record highs for the while thousand new jobs were created in the manufacturing industry the second best result for the to a lower thousand new jobs were created in the civil this figure represented an expansion and a record high for the in line with the positive developments in labor and with credit retail sales continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and signs of cooling cannot be according to data seasonally adjusted by the retail sales increased in recovering from the contraction observed in the second highest growth rate for the compared to the same months of retail sales increased by in october and in in the year trough retail sales grew robustly by in the last twelve by the steady growth of retail sales in the year reflects the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit in in the year through it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of and domestic and clothing and amongst expanded retail which include the sales of parts and and the strong growth of the first group should be highlighted in the for the next the continuity of the current expanding cycle is and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in november in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the a figure close to the record high of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached a new record high for the without the seasonal the rate stood above the level registered in the same month of while the average installed capacity utilization rate in the year through november stood above the observed in the same period of and and above the average rates registered in the same periods of and the reduction of idle capacity occurs in several despite the significant increase of in the year through the absorption of capital goods increased firmly due to the significant growth of capital goods imports in as well as of capital goods production the production of construction inputs increased in the year through showing robust the most recent data indicate that although investment has been contributing to soften the trend of increasing capacity utilization it has not been sufficient to stop this considering the recent behavior of capacity utilization the timely maturation of investment projects will be crucial to avoid relevant mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand in the relevant forecast period for monetary as stressed in previous the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continued to present robust performance in despite the expected deceleration at the in line with the evaluations present in inflation reports and previous copom minutes about important structural changes in the brazilian foreign in the the trade surplus reached a decrease relative to the same period of exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to a and compared to the same period of as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust economic activity in the the current account surplus reached billion in of regarding the external economic deceleration becomes more effective in the although high uncertainties still particularly concerning its magnitude and despite encouraging us gdp more recent particularly on labor market and as well as confidence indices and other leading point to significant although uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the us subprime mortgages market crisis over us and european financial institutions over credit conditions for households and the dominant opinion points out to a transitory this assessment to some the expectation that the monetary policy stance implemented in the to which fiscal incentives can be will smooth the us economic prospects for economic growth in europe and japan have also despite not provoking the same degree of concerns that surround the us economic on the other strong economic growth in main asian emerging which so far have been apparently little affected by the us mortgage have offset the effects of economic deceleration in mature in pressures over production factors availability have triggered inflationary pressures and tight monetary cycles in many emerging for mature prospects for monetary policy are more economies presenting more moderate inflationary pressures concerns and more evident credit contraction tend to present additional monetary policy on the other in economies where inflation rates are above their respective the scope for reaction to the contraction caused by the credit crisis seems more in this volatility and risk aversion indicators worsened again since the last copom in particular since the start of affecting the behavior of brazilian assets brazilian economic activity does not seem to have been significantly impacted by the persistent deterioration on global financial markets and although not decoupled from external economic should sustain its growth essentially driven by domestic oil a systematic source of international remained at historically high despite below the record high observed at the start of and also continued highly this behavior in addition to structural changes in global energy recurrent geopolitical despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil the main scenario considered by the copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in as observed in apart from the trajectory of domestic gasoline one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts the domestic both through productive such as the as well as by the deterioration of inflation the prices of other especially have also increased since the last copom despite more pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and the turmoil on global financial assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following for projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices were both maintained at the projections for electricity and fixed telephone prices adjustments in were set at and the projection for regulated prices based on individual totaled in down from in the december inflation this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total december the projection for regulated prices inflation in remained at the same considered in the last inflation this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap estimates a spread in the fourth quarter of under the benchmark the swap rate trajectory points to a spread in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the target for the consolidated public sector primary surplus in and adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the december copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased significantly to up from ahead inflation expectations changed more to up from considering the composition of monthly inflation market for inflation expectations increased to up from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased significantly compared to the value considered at the december copom and is close to the target established by the cmn for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the value considered at the december copom above the central target for the the projection for based on both scenarios are stable relative to the december inflation and remained below the target for the benchmark scenario and above the target for the market monetary policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion continues quite being responsible at least partially for the inflationary pressures observed in the despite the imports growth and the benign investment even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since the committee believes that the prospects for brazilian external financing in the forecast period according to newly available that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflation on the other relevant inflationary pressures continue to be present both in mature and emerging evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global the copom reaffirms the vision for the brazilian an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration would cause a risk factor of ambiguous on the one decreasing net exports would act as a factor to restrain aggregate the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic on the other the alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two in the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets risk aversion could resulting in decreased demand for brazilian assets and depreciation of their in the medium a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain brazilian although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets additional uncertainties surround the inflation and the risk of materialization of a less benign scenario the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last the copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has because the heated demand and market of in addition to the possibility of existence of supply restrictions in some can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the committee understands that the prospects for this as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price depend mostly on inflation which remain carefully although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the for such as in the services in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as inflation expectations within the forecast discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets for this to it is important that inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and do not point to persistent the committee once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and in the monetary easing started in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts nor have the effects of economic activity on inflation completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit growth and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next the lagged remaining effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute on a significant way to this these issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of and the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive this together with the external has helped to mitigate inflationary the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by the remaining impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented until september continues to present risks to inflationary in this the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and demand is even more relevant to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and that is the reason why variables such as inflation the balance of risks associated to the scenario and especially the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so at the current characterized by the deterioration in the balance of inflationary prudence assumes an even more important role in this the copom evaluates that signals of economy heating and inflation expectations increase heightened the risks for the concretization of the benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the targets as reflected in the in this even considering at the the maintenance of the basic interest rate is the most adequate the committee affirms that is ready to adopt a different by adjusting the monetary policy in the case of consolidation of a divergent scenario between projected inflation and the targets evaluating the economic scenario and inflation the committee unanimously decided to maintain the selic target rate at per without the committee will monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until the next when it will define the next steps in its monetary policy under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine price prospective dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its domestic demand continues to expand economic activity including sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already are still not fully the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary in light of robust domestic demand seem to become less at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority must remain vigilant to avoid that uncertainties contaminate longer time if the risk profile deteriorates in a matter that implies shifts in the inflation basic prospective the committee will promptly adjust monetary policy stance to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on march for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september of data analyzed by the copom inflation ipca inflation increased in up from in november and in food and beverage prices increased in up from and in the two preceding mainly driven by higher prices of beef and beans which contributed and for the ipca headline fuel prices pressured the december due to the increase in the price of after presenting yearly decreases for four consecutive ipca increased in up from in still below the target established by the national monetary council for the the evolution of the ipca was to market prices inflation influenced by the increase in food which had increased in regulated prices inflation totaled in compared to in favored by the reduction in energy the several ipca core inflation measures increased in both on a and on a the smoothed trimmed means core rose and in according to the same comparison up from and in the trimmed means core reached in up from in totaling in the last twelve months through compared to in the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in up from in totaling in the last twelve up from in the increased in december and in up from in increasing both on a basis and on a yearly basis for every index the increased up from in reaching in the up from in the inflation measured by the totaled in up from in totaling in the up from in the incc increased in up from in accumulating in the compared to in the behavior of in december was driven by the acceleration in several mainly food prices up from in accumulating in after a decrease in the remaining groups presented yearly changes below the the core inflation measure increased in the up from in the acceleration of in december reflected the higher change in industrial prices up from in the agricultural ipa elevated reducing relative to the main drivers of upward industrial prices in december were the prices of oil and fat fuel oil and fertilizers increased and moisturized ethylic alcohol amongst agricultural it bears emphasizing the increase in the prices of beans corn and soybeans industrial ipa accumulated in compared to in while agricultural ipa changed in up from in economic activity according to monthly survey retail sales increased seasonally adjusted in due to increases in all four activities included in the general clothing and shoes fuel and lubricants furniture and home appliances and sales of and food beverages and tobacco sales of vehicles and parts and which are not part of the general retail sales decreased in the retail sales

indicators increased and expanding by and in the year through compared to the same period of according to the last comparison evolution of domestic production of capital goods reflected the performances of agricultural electric and serialized industrial imports of capital goods increased seasonally adjusted in november and in the year through expansion reached reflecting investment growth in brazilian economy in bndes funding for mid and investment totaled billion in the year through exceeding in the disbursements in the same period of according to monthly industrial survey industrial production decreased in while the moving average expanded by reaching a record high for the seasonally adjusted industrial activity increased compared to the same month of last expanding by in the year through november and in the last twelve monthly decrease of industrial output reflected the expansion of capital goods production and the falls in the other use which reached for intermediate for durable consumer goods and for and consumer in the year through capital goods production increased compared to the same period of sustaining a expansion since the beginning of the according to the same comparison the production of durable consumer intermediate goods and semi and consumer goods increased and according to cni seasonally adjusted by the real sales increased and hours worked in production reduced in in the year through these indicators increased and compared to the same period of considering seasonally adjusted the utilization of installed capacity stood at in below october while observed data series increased according to vehicles production reached thousand units in a expansion compared to the same month of in seasonally adjusted production declined domestic sales expanded while exports decreased annual production reached the record high of thousand vehicles in a increase compared to the previous with a expansion in domestic while exports declined still according to production of agricultural machines and trucks increased and in the in line with the recovery of agricultural income and investment expansion in this according to the survey carried out by the ibge in the grains harvest reached million tons in a growth and a new record reflecting both favorable weather conditions and the incentive caused by the elevation of agricultural prices in the international as well as productivity increase derived from significant investment in agricultural machines and equipment and fertilizers and agricultural the survey also pointed to a reduction in coffee mainly due to the biennial periodicity of its and to a expansion in sugar cane reflecting the increase in planted area due to the growing interest in fuel alcohol with the third estimate for the planted area and grains production are expected to grow by and surveys and expectations the survey showed a elevation in the consumer confidence index in reflecting the fall in the consumer expectations index and the increase in the current economic conditions index the icc increased compared to january driven by expansions of and in the iec and according to the fgv the icc grew in reaching a record high for the series started in september this result reflected the elevation in the current situation index and the increase in the expectations index which computes ahead compared to december there were elevations of in the in the isa and in the these indices increased and in still according to the the industry confidence index decreased to in down from in the previous mainly due to the fall of the to from the isa also declined in the from the ici expanded compared to december showing an increase in when the isa and the ie grew and according to the fgv manufacturing industry installed capacity utilization reached high levels in all use categories in standing at below the previous month and above the december in installed capacity utilization reached

by and in the year through the number of workers and the number of formal workers grew by and while the number of employers and informal workers decreased by and the same survey points out that real average earnings reached in increasing and real payroll grew and according to the same respective comparison in the year through real average earnings and real payroll increased and in manufacturing employment stayed unchanged according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the on the other in the year through manufacturing employment increased while real manufacturing payroll raised credit and delinquency rates credit operations in the financial system increased in totaling a expansion in according to the same comparison credit operations increased and while earmarked credit operations expanded by and credit operations continued to be favored by the strength of leasing which expanded in credit to individuals and in credit to in regarding earmarked the most significant expansions in the last twelve months were related to housing and to the agricultural sector considering credit operations by economic loans to industries increased in december and in while loans to commerce grew

in cancelled and in the the average net delinquency rate reached up from in external environment uncertainties about the evolution of international economy remain in an environment of continuity of disturbances in real estate the elevation of commodities prices and the persistence of credit market risks of global economic deceleration are reinforced by the downward revisions for global the recent evolution of the main economic indicators in the especially regarding the increase in the unemployment which reached in and the fall in the confidence of managers and suggest a deterioration of the economic scenario in worsening retail sales and slowing housing high levels of delinquency in mortgage the recognition of significant losses in the financial industry and the long duration of the credit tightening reinforce this since the middle of inflationary pressures stemming from food and energy prices have in developed central especially the european central bank and the bank of japan would maintain the monetary tightening temporally if there the necessity to provide more liquidity to credit markets and restrain the worsening expectations for economic in central banks of emerging which remain resistant to the financial crisis started to interrupt or revert the monetary easing aiming at increasing the liquidity in the financial market and reducing pressures in interbank central banks in the euro canada and in coordinated have intervened in the markets through forward both in domestic currency and in dollar and bank of foreign trade and international reserves in brazilian

billion in the month and billion in the money market and open market operations in the period between the december and january copom the future interest rates especially in medium and longer this movement was driven by the release of data for inflation and the increase of inflation as well as the of which created uncertainties regarding the fulfillment of the fiscal in the external significant losses of financial still related to the us subprime mortgage market crisis and the increasing concern of recession in the us despite the release of incentive fiscal provoked strong falls in the stock markets and heightened risk between december and january and rates remained while the rates increased and rates increased and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal

registered in the same period of as a inflation reached in the highest change recorded since up from in and in the last twelve months through november the acceleration of consumer price trailing inflation mirrors the behavior of both regulated prices and market market prices and regulated prices increased and up from and in both prices of tradable goods and goods accelerated on a trailing reaching and respectively to and in the price of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than the prices of increased in the twelve months through december compared to in november and in december preliminary data for january point to consumer inflation index above that observed in considering broader twelvemonth ipca trailing inflation trended upwards since the second quarter of reached levels close to the upper limit of the tolerance interval after june and has reduced since october it reached market under this comparison which started to accelerate more intensely from the second quarter of started to cool down in the third quarter of in the case of regulated whose behavior incorporates more intensely past inflation trailing inflation continued to trend in information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed in the last quarters tends to be gradually overcome by a process that should be led by the behavior of market while regulated price inflation should show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed divergent behavior in the last but converged in the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices decreased from in october to in november and in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures showed relative recording and in and in november and in similarly to the headline the three core inflation measures remarkably accelerated in compared to with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core also in line with headline trailing core inflation measures seem to have reached record highs in september and trimmed means core inflation or in october inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated reducing despite to levels above the midpoint of the it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion which remarkably increased in november and continued to point to an inflationary process relatively reduced in december to compared to in december the general price index inflation changed from in november to in on a trailing inflation increased in down from in compared to in december the acceleration of in reflected the behavior of its three main the consumer price increased in while the wholesale price index totaled in according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in regarding the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of industrial the agricultural ipa reached in while the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached in it bears noticing despite the exchange rate depreciation occurred since both wholesale agricultural and industrial prices have showed deflation at the as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased in after falling by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the retreat observed in industrial output decreased by in less three working days than the previous it bears emphasizing that the severe climatic conditions observed in the south of the country also influenced the industrial performance in as industrial output grew in the year through with respective increases of and in manufacturing and in mining on a basis industrial output retreated by in with respective falls of and in mining and manufacturing data already released for the last months in to the interruption of the industrial production expansion cycle in the last quarter of industrial activity has been influenced by the international both due to its effects over credit and over business and in this several industrial segments have been led to adjust inventories and reduce with highlights to the sectors of especially ironworks and among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of capital goods decreased by in regarding the other use intermediate goods production decreased consumer goods production retreated by and the production of durable goods strongly influenced by the automotive reduced by in the capital goods production leads the with a followed by the elevation in durable consumer goods the recent slowdown in capital goods production reflects the persistence of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business on its the cooling in the pace of expansion of durable goods production the tightening of credit the deterioration of consumer expectations and the process of reduction mentioned such developments should continue to be evidenced by the december labor market started to record ambiguous combining positive aspects with significant accommodation of formal job creation at the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey increased from in october to in down from in november as a the average unemployment rate in the first eleven months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate stood at in above the observed in at a historically low in average earnings increased in totaling increases of in the year and in the last twelve in average real earnings increased and in the year through average real earnings increased by while employment expanded by as a real payroll increased expansion in in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment retreated by in after increasing by in resulting in a growth in the quarter ended in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment fell in november falling in october and increasing by in totaling increases of in the last twelve months and still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate significant loss of dynamism in the generation of formal employment at the end of in jobs were dismissed to the negative result of in approximately two fold the historical average for the on the other employment reached the third best result for the yearly historical reaching thousand hires for the only below the results for thousand and thousand formal employment reduced by in seasonally and observed data point to a expansion in the last twelve the manufacturing industry recorded the highest dismissal with the reduction of jobs seasonally adjusted followed by the agricultural and the services which dismissed and the civil construction sector dismissed workers the retail sector dismissed workers the services sector recorded the highest hiring rate in the year or a historical record high for the the retail sector recorded the second most important growth followed by the civil construction a record high for the and the manufacturing industry or according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales decreased by in after decreasing in on a it reduced by and grew in the year through the moving average of expanded retail sales decreased in the quarter ended in compared to the quarter ended in according to seasonally adjusted on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of orthopedic and perfumery magazines and and and supermarket and food the negative key drivers were and part and and material and sectors more sensitive to the credit supply in the year through cumulative growth was more significant in material and and personal and domestic similar to the observed in october and expanded retail sales data for december should also evidence the effects of credit supply restrictions and the deterioration of consumer confidence over vehicle already captured by the data from the national federation of distribution of automotive vehicles for this preliminary evidence for january points to some recovery in the sales of partially in response to sectoral incentives granted by the the steady growth of retail sales had been in the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution may be favored by inflation but it will also be affected by the changes in the access to credit supply and by the deterioration of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in below the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing industry also showed reaching in down from in without the seasonal the nuci stood below the level registered in november as a the average rate in the year through november was above the level observed in the same period of the monthly adjusted nuci calculated by fundação getúlio vargas retreated strongly in december to standing below the level registered in the same month of the reduction in the nuci in december is also observed in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and civil construction inputs the reduction on nuci calculated by cni and fgv seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation on economic and points to significant increase of the idle capacity level of the manufacturing on the other recent data about the absorption of capital goods show contraction at the despite continuing to show compared to the same periods of the absorption of capital goods decreased in according to seasonally adjusted and expanded by in according to observed on its the production of civil construction inputs retreated at the margin in after showing stability in accumulating a growth in in evidences so far suggest an ongoing process of reduction in demand pressures on the productive capacity level of the manufacturing as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to register deceleration at the an already anticipated and which is in line with assessments present in previous inflation reports and copom in the trade surplus reached billion below exports and imports billion and equivalent to and over the reversal on the appreciation trend of the brl and the accommodation on the pace of expansion of domestic demand may contribute to the recovery of the trade while the reduction on price levels of exports acts on the opposite the decrease in the trade surpluses contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through november equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the continuity of stress on international financial which originated in the us and but whose impact on emerging economies has continued being the increased risk observed since after the bankruptcy of an important us financial led the authorities in the europe and oceania to intervene in an unprecedentedly way in their financial using wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in money systemic risk which has shown some intensified in the last the international liquidity contraction has been contributing to a deleverage process by asset in has been pressuring down the prices of financial in an environment of increased risk and shortage of capital the volatility of emerging currencies continues despite not showing the generalized trend of depreciation against the us dollar observed in the last months of regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary the dominant view still points to the despite at quite modest of global economic activity in but data released in the last weeks indicate a more intense and generalized cooling of activity in mature economies and also in several emerging there are evidences that the deeper weakening of economic activity in europe and parts of asia was in a significant manner due to the negative shock in the terms of trade caused by the elevation of commodities which is being on the other the problems in the financial system have been aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of which tends to reinforce the contraction in financial conditions as a the risk of intensification of the us in has been in recession since the end of and still continues to suffer the impacts of the housing sector with spillover effects on the labor whose together with the negative wealth effect associated to the fall in the prices of financial has affected significantly contributing for depressing the prevailing interpretation is that the activity in europe and japan should continue to lose dynamism in the next in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity is decelerating inflationary pressures have reduced in emerging where the secondary effects of raw materials price increases over consumer prices and the heated demand pressures over the supply expansion capacity had been more inflationary pressures have also been although they in many more in this the monetary policy stance is mainly expansionist in mature whereas in emerging which have been affected by the exchange rate depreciation in addition to the facts already the reaction seems to be more but expansionist bias also in mature the authorities have been announcing a series of initiatives aimed at sustaining economic particularly through fiscal which could contribute to a gradual economic on the other estimates on the fiscal costs for packages of macroeconomic stimulus and support to the financial sector have been which has caused pressures on the assessment of risk on many sovereign even in advanced oil prices remain highly despite currently being close to the levels observed at the last copom future markets quotations have also shown high without a defined uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the reaction to stimuli stemming from previous changes on relative prices and on the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the great uncertainty inherent to the projections of oil the main scenario adopted by the which assumes unchanged gasoline prices in remains but with the persistence of the current scenario in the oil it does not seem prudent to completely disregard the hypothesis of oil price reductions in it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline the reduction in international oil prices observed in the second half of can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation prices of agricultural commodities such as soybeans and which impact particularly the evolution of food have remarkably increased since the last copom reacting both to weather problems in important production as well as to the apparent exhaustion of investment repositioning by investors that had been allocating resources to these of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following the projected adjustment for for both gasoline and bottled gas prices were maintained at the projected adjustment for for fixed telephone and electricity prices were kept at and unchanged relative to the values considered in the december copom the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual was maintained unchanged at relative to the december copom this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total december the projection of regulated prices inflation for stood at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic on the benchmark based on the swap estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations group the ipca variation noticeably reduced to from for inflation expectations stand at considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca inflation decreased relative to the figure considered in the december copom and remains below the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for slightly decreased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom but remained around the central target for the inflation projection for based on the benchmark reduced compared to the figure considered in the december and is considerably below the central target for that on the other considering the market the inflation projection slightly staying around the central policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the pace of domestic demand which continued quite robust until the third quarter of and was at least partially responsible for the inflationary has considerably lost momentum since this deceleration is partly a result of a substantial and generalized cooling of economy activity on both emerging and on its the increase in risk aversion and the unprecedentedly constraints observed in liquidity conditions in the international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of in general the influence of the external scenario on the future trajectory of brazilian inflation continues to be subject to contradictory which can act with distinct intensity throughout time and surrounded by significant on the one the economic cooling has caused an increase in risk impacting the demand for brazilian and depreciating their on the other the more generalized economic deceleration in the last which may persist in the upcoming has caused the cooling of both commodities prices and external and has also negatively impacted local financial the trajectory of price indices evidences the reduction of inflationary external especially in mature but also in some emerging as a the net effect of the global deceleration over the inflation trajectory seems to so predominantly the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of favorable results achieved in the last the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risks to domestic inflation trajectory the evidences of accommodation of domestic and reduction of inflationary pressures over the market of despite remaining surrounded by may mitigate the of of wholesale prices have been showing deflation in the last upward pressures to consumer price the committee evaluates that the materialization of this as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized on consumer depend critically on economic inflation expectations for the inflation expectations remain in levels above the inflation despite having remarkably decreased since the last copom meeting and continue to be carefully it is worth noticing according to data domestic demand should exert lesser pressures over the prices of nontradable such as in the upcoming in this the copom reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation this point of view is even more important in periods of higher prospects for the evolution of economic activity have continued to deteriorate since the last copom despite the fact that industrial activity data have been partially reflecting a process of inventory which tends to it is particularly important to the effects of the international crisis over domestic financial conditions have resulted in severe decline of the credit contribution to support domestic the intensification of the international crisis has caused a negative effect on consumers and businessmen if this situation the strength of economic activity will increasingly depend on payroll expansion and on the effects of governmental transfers expected for these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the upcoming the copom evaluates that the loss of strength on domestic demand should result in reduction of inflationary on the other the remaining risks for the inflationary dynamics derive from the trajectory of brazilian assets amidst a process of decreasing external sources of funding and mechanisms of price adjustments that contribute to prolong inflationary pressures observed last the balance of those influences over the prospective trajectory of inflation will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the strategy aims to bring inflation back to the midpoint target of during as already established by the and keep it in a consistent level relative to the target path during such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with uncertainties inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of signs of economic activity evidenced since the last meeting for the industrial production indicators exacerbated by an inventory cycle some available data on labor market and industrial capacity utilization as well as on consumers and businessmen together with lower inflation expectations for relevant the risks of of a benign inflation in which ipca would resume evolution in line with the targets have been markedly the evolution of the prospective scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the the copom also understands that demand deceleration has reduced the pressure over supply conditions observed in most of which should significantly contribute to deflate the monetary policy should be cautiously aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets despite some scope for an easing the committee believes that the consolidation of restrictive financial conditions for a longer period should exert in significant contraction effect over demand throughout a relevant deflation under such the majority of the copom taking into account the balance of risks for economic activity for the prospective inflation as well as the absence of clear evidence of effects over stemming from the depreciation of the exchange in an environment of global reduction of inflationary has at this to reduce the selic rate by other copom members evaluate in light of the presence of inflationary feedback mechanisms in the as well as the consequences of the balance of payments adjusting a more moderate reduction of the selic rate would represent a more consistent signal of the prospective trend of inflation convergence to the targets path and would be more adequate to an optimal pace of the easing in such taking into account inflation the copom has at this to reduce the selic rate to without five votes were in favor of this monetary policy action while three were in favor of reducing the selic rate by with such the committee has initiates a process of monetary policy immediately accomplishing significant part of the selic rate without harming the commitment to the inflation under the inflation targeting the committee guides its decisions according to projected analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prices and the balance of risks associated to their there are signs after a long expansion domestic demand has started to have a contraction influence over economic despite persistence of incentive such as income it is worth noticing that inflation expectations for have substantially decreased since the last committee on the other the strong global economy deceleration has resulted in downward pressures over wholesale despite the exchange rate in such monetary policy can be more flexible without putting at risk inflation convergence to the targets if deterioration on the risk profile implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic considered by the committee at this the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the at the end of the it was announced that the committee would reconvene on march for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom the ipca changed in showing a decrease in inflation compared to the december and to the november ipca in the ipca accumulated a compared to in the twelve months through and in representing the highest annual change since the result showed increases of in market prices and of in regulated compared to and in the household food group contributed for the representing of the annual ipca market prices

the seasonally adjusted in industrial production recorded a record low for the series since may as a the production of the quarter ended in november stood below that of the quarter ended in considering seasonally adjusted the four use categories presented negative with highlights to the decrease in durable consumer goods a record low for the series since december in addition to the weak performance of automotive the retractions in the production of audio and video equipments and kitchen appliances also contributed to the the production of and consumer whose consumption is more dependent on the presented the lowest decrease among the use categories capital and intermediate goods declined and in industrial production decreased in a record low for the series since december only five out of the twenty six manufacturing industry activities surveyed expanded in november according to the same comparison with highlights to the production of other transportation which increased backed up by the production of airplanes and the production of with a increase in the according to the same comparison the most important negative drivers were office machines and it equipment electronic material and communication equipment shoes and leather furniture and vehicles considering the use the production of durable consumer intermediate goods and and consumer goods

similarly to the observed in the previous three the industry confidence index reached points in seasonally falling by points and points relative to the index reached a record low since october emphasizing the pessimistic businessmen expectations about industrial already captured in the november among its and also in seasonally adjusted the current situation index leveled at points below the november the expectations index declined by the same reaching a record low for the series started in april in accordance with the fgv manufacturing industry installed capacity utilization reached in below december and in the seasonally adjusted below the previous when these changes registered and the seasonally adjusted index for december was close to the average of the last in december all use categories registered with the sharpest retraction for consumer goods considering industrial only pharmaceuticals and veterinary products among the negative it bears highlighting transportation material metallurgy and mechanics according to the same comparison market according to the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were eliminated in december result that ratifies the loss of dynamism in the labor outlined since employment level decreased by in seasonally adjusted manufacturing industry was the sector that recorded the higher number of followed by agriculture and which eliminated and thousand in new jobs were compared to the creation of jobs in the level of formal jobs grew in by the level of employment in the construction sector registered the higher increase

population in returning to the august and september after a decline in compared to november unemployment declined despite the slight the unemployment rate recorded the lowest level for november months since the beginning of the new pme started in march the relative stability of the unemployment rate in reflected the dismissal of thousand workers from the labor market and the elimination of thousand

increased by in and expanded by representing the second consecutive month of deceleration according to this comparison real payrolls increased by in and by and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in increasing by in monthly terms and on a trailing this volume corresponded to of compared to the figures of october and november according to the same comparison credit operations increased and with a share of in the total of financial registered the cooling in the dynamism of operations with both in the arrangements that includes credit used as reference to the interest rate and in the operations to rental which increased in twelve but only in earmarked credit operations increased and on a trailing as result of increases of in credit operations performed by the bndes development and in housing loans and considering the segmentation by economic it is worth mentioning loans to which increased in november and in the last twelve the average interest rate

environment since the global macroeconomic scenario has reflected the deepening of the the current economic and financial conditions have implied a decline in consumption and deterioration of business and consumer impacting negatively investment and real outlining the most severe economic reversal since the recession in united united italy and among the dramatic decline in the installed capacity utilization verified and the retraction in international trade are responsible for the deepening in the decline in the prices of oil in this which progressively contaminates emerging both through the fall in the imports of developed countries and through the growing difficulty of external exposes the fragility of the decoupling thesis and translates into estimates of global gdp contraction of approximately in the fourth quarter of which should be added up to the contraction in the first quarter of the domestic demand collapse and its effects over the international among credit have provoked the increase in the unemployment which reached in december in the us this added up to the deepening of the in the financial has evidenced the need of fiscal in this new packages of fiscal preferentially directed to expenditures in infrastructure and tax were released in the france and among in light of the magnitude of reversal of the inflationary process and the weakening of the economic initially occurred in the developed but progressively reaching emerging a continuous monetary policy easing process can be observed in global even in the latin where the central banks of chile and mexico started a process of interest rate reduction between december and in japan and in the where the interest rates are almost the central banks changed the focus of monetary acting under the outlook of quantitative easing and therefore widening their balance sheets balance sheets increased to trillion in december up from billion in in the the repo rate stood at the lowest level since the foundation of the more than years trade and international reserves brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in in the exports reached and growing by and on a daily average total external trade recorded billion in a increase related to on a daily average despite the favorable balance in exports and imports reduced by and on a daily average compared to december signaling the cooling of total external based on the liquidity international reserves totaled billion in with increases of million in the month and billion relative to the end of under the cash international reserves totaled recording a million decrease market and open market operations after the last copom meeting in the future yield curve shifted sharply downward in the whole this behavior was mainly driven by the fall in the current and expected inflation and by the released indicators that signaled the reduction of the expansion pace of economic negatively impacting in the labor in the external the federal open market committee decision to on the december a reference range from zero to to the fed also contributed to this between december and january and rates decreased by bps and and rates decreased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation decreased to on january down from on december in the period between december and january the bcb carried out traditional fx swap in which assumed a long position in domestic interest rate and a short position in these operations totaled rolling contracts due on january and february in its open market the bcb carried from december to january weekly and sevenmonth fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations reached of which billion were in

the last copom meeting is consistent with a gradual recovery of the brazilian the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook has been as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced this supports risk appetite towards emerging the committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has to a large as inflation developments remain with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable or low this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy inflation expectations collected by the focus survey retreated to around percent for expectations for and remain around percent and the path of administered prices underlying the inflation scenarios produced by the copom assumes increases of percent for percent for and percent for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and this scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends and at percent per year and increases to during the course of under these the inflation projections stand around percent for percent for and percent for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the october copom meeting risks around baseline inflation scenario the committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both on the one possible effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available all members agreed that the economy remains on a gradual recovery with improvements in employment even at this early stage of the this conjuncture has led to increases in growth projections for the current year and for consistent with a view that the recovery is more the committee emphasized the vision owing to the current levels of slack in the marginal revisions in the intensity of recovery would not lead to material revisions in the expected path for regarding the global the committee confirmed the recent favorable evolution of the global which shows a gradual economic without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced the committee acknowledged that the continuing process of normalization of monetary policy in major countries led to slightly less accommodative global financial despite the limited impact on the emerging economies so in this the copom reaffirmed that the brazilian economy shows greater capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in the global given its robust balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospects of economic the copom pointed out the risk for the brazilian economy of a reversal in this benign bank of brazil in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent years and all members agreed that the prospects for to a large have evolved as the committee assessed the current situation of the domestic electric power generation sector and incorporated the recent changes in tariffs into its baseline scenario for inflation for the next in the administered prices have constituted an inflationary in the opposite and in a substantially greater the dynamics of food prices constitute a relevant disinflationary with the prospect of a percent price reduction in the the food at home component measured by the ipca explains a large share of the inflation deviation from the percent target set for the current regarding monetary there was consensus as in the case of other possible relative price adjustments resulting from supply with anchored inflation monetary policy should only address the effects of these the committee reiterates that its reaction to possible changes in relative such as in food and possible adjustments of electric power will be that is to monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply the copom discussed the levels and the path of including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary some measures of underlying inflation were considered to be at comfortable levels while others at low the committee also discussed the extent to which their trajectories are compatible with the convergence of inflation towards the within the relevant horizon for monetary the copom reaffirmed the view that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks in both the risk that effects of supply shocks and the propagation of the low current levels of inflation will lead to a prospective inflation as well as the risk of a setback in the global outlook in a context of frustration of expectations about the reforms and necessary the committee expressed the view that economic conditions with anchored inflation measures of underlying inflation at comfortable inflation projections a little below target for and a high level of economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary with interest rates below the structural although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of committee members expressed an understanding that current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the copom understands that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over the committee understands for a given estimate of the length of the monetary easing the pace of easing depends on the stage of the without necessarily reflecting changes in its baseline scenario or risk all copom members agreed that the evolution of the outlook and the balance of risks since its october meeting took place as and compatible with the selic rate reduction to percent per the committee then discussed the next step in conducting monetary on the one they evaluated that several measures of underlying inflation are at comfortable or low including the components that are most sensitive to the economic cycle and monetary and reflected on the path of inflation towards the on the other they pondered on the risk that the current inflationary environment may be interrupted by a frustration of expectations on the continuity of the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian particularly in a context of reversal of the current favorable external scenario for emerging the committee deemed appropriate to signal as long as the outlook evolves according to the baseline and because of the stage of the easing an additional moderate reduction in the magnitude of easing at the next meeting seems adequate from the current they deemed appropriate to warn that this view is more susceptible to changes in the evolution of the scenario and associated risks than in previous the copom also assessed the extension of the cycle and the convenience of signaling steps subsequent to the next there was consensus in maintaining freedom of action and to signal that the current stage of the cycle recommends caution in conducting monetary bank of brazil the committee reaffirmed its preference for communicating conditionalities on the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality that guides its this contributes to increase transparency and improve copom in this it was once again highlighted that the easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the brazilian economy are fundamental for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary policy and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the economy and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by percentage to percent per without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes and is compatible with the monetary easing the committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural the copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over the evolution of the baseline in line with and the stage of the monetary easing cycle made it appropriate to reduce the selic rate by percentage point at this copom regarding the next provided the baseline scenario evolves as and taking into account the stage of the monetary easing at this time the copom views an additional moderate reduction of the pace of easing as the committee views this guidance as more susceptible to changes in its baseline scenario and balance of risks than in the previous going the committee judges that the current stage of the cycle recommends caution in conducting monetary the copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation projections and the following committee members voted for this ilan goldfajn carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes maurício costa de otávio ribeiro paulo sérgio neves de reinaldo le sidnei corrêa marques and tiago couto update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the increase in the number of cases and the emergence of new virus strains are reverting previous mobility gains and should affect new fiscal stimulus in some developed countries and the rollout of immunization programs should promote a solid economic recovery in the medium economic slack and communication of central banks of major economies suggest that monetary stimuli will last resulting in a favorable environment for emerging turning to the brazilian indicators regarding growth at the end of last year have been better than but they do not capture the effects of the recent increase in the number of uncertainty about economic growth remains larger than especially for the first quarter of this concurrently with the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer the various measures of underlying inflation are in levels above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the recent increase in commodities prices and its effects on food and fuel prices imply an increase in inflation forecasts for the next in spite of the stronger inflationary the committee maintains the diagnosis that the current shocks are although more persistent than the copom continues to closely monitor the evolution of in particular core inflation the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation especially when this slack is concentrated in the service this risk increases if a slower reversion of the pandemic effects lengthens the environment of high uncertainty and precautionary on the other an extension of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that aggravates the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the relative increase in the risks of these events implies an upward asymmetry to the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the international the committee assessed on the one the emergence of new variants of the virus and recent discussions about reflation in the usa new sources of risk for economic activity and asset prices in emerging on the other this risk is counterbalanced by the rollout of extensive immunization programs against the new fiscal stimuli in some developed countries and the communication of central banks of major economies that monetary stimuli will last the committee judged for the result of this set of factors is a favorable environment for emerging the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they evaluated despite the partial reduction in governmental transfer available data for the end of last year have been positively these data do not capture the effects of the recent increase in the number of the unpredictability associated with the pandemic and the necessary adjustment in government spending from increases the uncertainty about the economic the committee considers that the risks associated with both the pandemic developments and the expected unwinding of the emergency transfer programs may lead to a domestic scenario characterized by more gradualism or even a temporary reversal of the economic the copom members debated on the level of economic the committee believes that the pandemic continues to have heterogeneous effects on different economic the transfer programs from the government have reduced slack in the goods service especially those most directly affected by social face a greater reduction in the evolution of these sectoral gaps will depend on the pandemic developments and on the adjustment in public some members of the committee pointed out that labor market data on the formal sector suggest that the overall economic slack has reduced more rapidly than most felt that other labor market data did not support this the committee discussed the implementation of monetary according to the forward guidance introduced since its meeting the copom would not reduce the monetary stimulus as long as three conditions were the copom has evaluated that two of these conditions still the fiscal regime has not and inflation expectations remain the committee judges that the third condition no longer as inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline are sufficiently close to the inflation target over the relevant horizon for monetary as a the committee decided to drop its forward monetary policy will follow the usual analysis of the balance of risks for the prospective the copom continued its considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline inflation projections are around the target in the relevant the committee also considered that fiscal risks generate an upward bias in these potentially justifying an increase in policy rates earlier than that assumed in its baseline the copom members discussed the impact of this asymmetry in the balance of risks in the appropriate degree of monetary in some members questioned whether it would still be appropriate to maintain an extraordinarily high degree of given the normalization of the economic activity observed in recent since the may copom when the desired degree of monetary stimulus was characterized as there has been a reversal on the disinflationary shock that occurred in the first months of the a reversal of the downward trend on inflation expectations and a decline on economic bringing inflation projections on the baseline scenario closer to its target in the relevant these members believe that the copom should consider starting a process of partial reducing the degree of monetary the committee concluded that despite some normalization in economic uncertainty regarding the future dynamics of main economic variables remains above the the next data release will be very informative about the evolution of the economic and fiscal the benefits of waiting for these releases to decide on the next steps of monetary policy outweigh the for this at this time the copom deemed it appropriate to maintain the extraordinarily high degree of monetary monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that uncertainty regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest according to the forward guidance introduced in its meeting the copom would not reduce the monetary stimulus as long as specified conditions were based on new the committee judges that those conditions no longer as inflation as well as inflation projections for its baseline are sufficiently close to the inflation target over the relevant horizon for monetary the forward guidance no longer holds monetary policy will follow the usual analysis of the balance of risks for the prospective the copom reiterates that the removal of the forward guidance does not mechanically imply interest rates at this uncertainties regarding the evolution of growth still prescribe an extraordinarily strong monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro damaso and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the pandemic is causing a significant slowdown in global a fall in commodity and an increase in asset prices against this despite the additional provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major and some moderation in financial assets the environment for emerging economies remains with capital outflows significantly larger than in previous turning to economic data through march reflect only partly the impact from the pandemic over the brazilian higher frequency and more timely indicators for april show that the economic contraction will be significantly deeper than forecasted in the previous several measures of underlying inflation are running below the levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and projections have experienced relevant revisions and incorporate the prospect of significant deflation in the coming there was a further decline in oil prices and a sharp drop in domestic fuel prices for which will continue to impact consumer prices in the coming the most recent readings of price indices showed significant disinflationary effects on prices of services and industrial projections and scenarios are affected by assumptions about the future path of oil which have oscillated at historically low levels due to an expansionary supply shock a fall in global the following scenarios consider that brent oil prices rise about by the end of compared with the average prices of the week prior to the copom in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and constant exchange rate at the copom projections stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and constant exchange rate at yields unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the march copom meeting around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation this risk increases if a worsening of the pandemic implies an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger or longer than on the other fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal trajectory or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk premium and imply a path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the copom judges as in previous international the increase in risk and the consequent asset make the environment more challenging for emerging unlike other recent in which the epicenter was in the northern in the current crisis it moved to all along with the projections point to a global recession with few historical these two factors help explain capital outflows significantly larger than in previous among the emerging those with greater fiscal vulnerability are prone to be the most the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they assessed despite few data available for there is enough evidence that the economy will contract strongly during the second quarter of the the committee also discussed on the pace of economic they considered unless there are medical advancements in the fight against the it is plausible to consider a scenario in which the recovery is more gradual and marked by comings and the baseline scenario assumes a sharp drop in gdp in the first half of the followed by a gradual recovery from the third quarter value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed in the five business days ended in the last day of the week prior to the copom central do copom the copom members debated about the level of economic they reinforced their view that the pandemic shall exert a disinflationary impact on the brazilian together with a sharp increase in economic the sudden growth in uncertainty among economic agents may result in an increase in precautionary savings a significant decline in aggregate the committee then discussed the potential existence of an effective lower bound for the brazilian policy most members pondered that this limit would be significantly higher in emerging economies than in developed due to a risk it was also pointed out that this premium tends to be higher in given the relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal in this we would be close to a level where further reductions in the policy rate could be accompanied by instability in financial markets and asset another member argued in there is no reason for such a minimum operational since traditional channels of monetary policy remain without although possibly with an increased effect of changes in the policy rate on financial asset the committee as a whole recognized the importance of gradualism in the conduct of monetary policy for assessing the response of financial asset concerning the structural rate of the the committee assessed that it also reflects economic expectations about the prospective fiscal in the the interaction between the deterioration of the external frustrations regarding the continuity of the reforms and possible permanent changes to the public accounts adjustment process may threaten the downward path of the structural interest the copom recognizes at this the disinflationary although accompanied by greater fiscal has triggered a downward revision on inflation expectations towards levels not compatible with the within the relevant horizon for monetary this decline holds for expectations measured by both the focus survey and the inflation extracted from government debt the committee reaffirms its commitment to the inflation target set by the national monetary which has always been and still is the main objective of monetary two committee members pondered even with the possibility of an increase in the structural it could be appropriate to provide the overall monetary stimulus in combination with a guidance of keeping the interest rate constant for the next in order to reduce the probability of missing the inflation target for the prevalent view was in light of the elevated uncertainty the remaining scope for monetary policy is unknown and may be the copom chose to provide a more moderate for the benefit of gathering more information until its next monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate by percentage points to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the copom believes that the current state of affairs recommends an unusually large monetary but it reinforces that there are potential limits to the remaining space for the committee believes that the fiscal trajectory over the next as well as the perception of its will be crucial to determine the length of the the next conditional on the fiscal scenario and on the economic the committee considers a final monetary not larger than this to complete the change to the policy rate that it deems adequate to counteract the economic consequences from the the committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the effects of the pandemic in the as well as a decline in fiscal will be essential to determine its next the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio fernanda feitosa costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the evolution of the delta variant adds risk to the recovery of the world the committee considers in spite of the recent movements in the yield there is still a relevant upward inflation risk in the central the environment for emerging economies remains favorable with the monetary with the fiscal and with the reopening of the major turning to the brazilian recent indicators continue evolving satisfactorily and do not call for relevant revisions in growth which display a robust economic recovery during the second half of the the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and consumer inflation has been recent indicators show a worse it is noteworthy the surprise with the underlying services inflation and the continuing pressure on industrial which cause core measures to there is new pressure in volatile such as the possible additional increase in electricity fares and food both due to adverse weather these factors imply significant revisions in the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that rises to in remains at this level during and drops to during in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for and the energy flag is assumed to be remaining at level in december each risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the recent increase in the price of international commoditiesmeasured in local currency would produce a inflation in the baseline on the other further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the risk despite the recent improvement of debt sustainability the elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the committee assessed that the fiscal and monetary stimuli are promoting robust growth and inflation dynamics in central and emerging economies should increasingly depend on demand in this regard further discussions about the risk of a lasting inflation increase in the united states and the associated repricing of financial assets could turn the environment for emerging economies the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they considered that the latest available data continues to evolve in line with growth in the the second half of the year should bring a robust as the effects of the vaccination are felt more the committee noticed that the median of growth forecasts in the focus survey is appreciably more optimistic than those of its baseline scenario and pondered whether the difficulties related to seasonal adjustments due to the pandemic shock would explain this the copom members then debated the level of economic although the economic slack as a whole is quickly returning to the late the committee considered that the pandemic still produces heterogeneous effects on economic sectors in on the labor with consequences for the recent and prospective dynamics of the copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus the exchange rate at purchasing power and commodity prices in usd stable in real the inflation projections are aligned to the targets for and the committee judged that the fiscal risks continue to imply an upward bias in the this asymmetry in the balance of risks affects the appropriate degree of monetary thus justifying a path for monetary policy that is more restrictive than the one used in the baseline copom then evaluated different tightening paths for monetary considering the baseline scenario and the balance of the committee assessed that should there be no changes in the inflation conditioning factors subsequent uninterrupted interest rate increases are required up to a level above the neutral to obtain projections around the inflation targets in the relevant a tightening cycle of the policy rate to a level consistent with restrictive monetary policy has become the committee opted to communicate this maintaining transparency about the monetary policy path implied in its and reaffirming that this view will be systematically reassessed as changes in inflation determinants or in the balance of risks the committee discussed potential explanations for the difference between its baseline projections and the inflation expectations extracted from the focus expectations may incorporate different assumptions about the determinants of such as administered prices and economic as well as contain different perceptions on risk or alternative the long sequence of shocks and revisions of expectations may increase the perception of inflationary market participants may have different assumptions about the reaction function of monetary as a copom evaluated that the recent worsening in inertial components of amid the reopening of the service could cause a further deterioration in inflation raising the costs for its future the committee felt that it should once again underscore its unequivocal commitment to the pursuit of its inflation targets over the relevant horizon for monetary guided by its baseline scenario as well as its assessment of the balance of copom concluded that a quicker adjustment of monetary policy is the most appropriate strategy at this time to assure the convergence of inflation to its targets for and monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes to a lesser the adjustment also reflects the perception that the recent deterioration of inertial components of in a moment of reopening of the service could result in an additional deterioration of inflation the committee understands at this the strategy of a quicker monetary adjustment is the most appropriate to guarantee the anchoring of inflation without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full at this the baseline scenario and the balance of risks indicate as appropriate a tightening cycle of the policy rate to a level above the for the next the committee foresees another adjustment of the same copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the achievement of the inflation target and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto carolina de assis fabio fernanda rumenos manoel

organization for economic cooperation and development referring to and the pmi coincident relative to signal improvements at the margin in several advanced with prospects of growth above the in constrast to the observed in emerging regarding monetary accommodative stances have prevailed in the advanced in emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and in it consolidated above the price of the brent oil barrel has slightly retreated since the previous copom reflecting some cooling in geopolitical it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have decreased while the ones relative to metals have fallen on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations changed in the twelve months through september of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price for the whole year of was maintained at unchanged relative to the value considered at the august copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly unchanged relative to the august copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions as well as readjustments and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this for the whole year of bottled gas prices are projected to increase by and the fixed telephone tariff is projected to decrease the same values considered at the august copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated for the whole year of retreated to below the value considered at the august copom and the projected cumulative adjustment for the set of regulated prices in was maintained at the same value considered at the august copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus trajectories for is considered as the fiscal according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law project in a given the inflation projection considers as fiscal impulse the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca slightly from to for the median of the inflation projections increased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the value considered at the previous copom it remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also decreased relative to the value considered at the august and also stands above the inflation for in the baseline the inflation forecast decreased relative to the figure considered at the august copom meeting and increased in the market standing both above the for the third quarter of the inflation forecast stands above the target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity this year have with trend of intensification over the relevant horizon for the monetary there are localized improvements in advanced although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of domestic the committee highlights evidences of accommodation of commodities prices in the international as well as since the last there was some cooling in the tensions and in the volatility which were then observed in the currency the copom evaluates that the main scenario encompasses a more intense domestic activity pace in this and in the upcoming recent information indicate resumption of investments and continuity of household consumption the latter favored by public transfers and by the vigor in the labor market which reflects in historically low unemployment rates and in wages in domestic absorption has expanded at rates higher than gdp growth rates and tends to be benefited by the effects of fiscal policy by the expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the program of public services among other regarding the external component of the aggregate the main scenario anticipates a more benign course than that registered in recent the committee notes the speed of materialization of these expected gains depends on the confidence strengthening of companies and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal for the conditions are created so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation on the one hand would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit in the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over despite the moderation the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent quarters enable a natural and expected correction in relative for the these movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is also important to highlight for the the aforementioned exchange rate depreciation is a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the secondary effects stemming from and that would tend to materialize over longer can and should be limited by appropriate monetary policy the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it is in this the copom understands that it is appropriate to continue the adjustment pace of the monetary conditions continuing the basic interest rate the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without the committee evaluates that this decision will contribute to set inflation into decline and ensure that this trend persists in the upcoming the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to be relatively especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the remaining effects of the policy actions recently these the programs of public services the permissions for the exploration of among create good prospects for investments and industrial on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining despite the prospects of progress in the relevant these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on november for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as

agreements lines amounted while the outstanding totaled market and open market operations in the period that followed the august copom there was significant fluctuation of domestic interest especially the medium and long influenced mainly by external while the short end of the yield curve has always maintained the upward the rates for maturities greater than two years at first but reversed the movement from falling to levels below the one registered in the previous the release of the inflation considered more and the expectation for continued monetary tightening cycle contributed to the increase of the domestic the movement of reduction of rates was influenced by the maintenance of daily fx swap the fall in prices of the dollar against the various especially the and the reduction in us treasury bonds interest after the decision by the fomc on september of maintenance of the monetary stimuli in the united between august and october the and rates increased by and rates for maturities of two and three years retreated by and the real interest measured by the ratio between the nominal interest rate and the inflation expectation for the next twelve declined from in august to on october mainly due to an increase in inflation expectations for the next twelve from august to october the bcb carried out traditional fx swap auctions maturing between november and october these operations totaled the equivalent to of which billion relative to the rollover of the contracts maturing on october on october the fx short net result of the bcb regarding this instrument

overall daily average of the total outstanding of repurchase agreements of the bcb decreased from between july and august to between august and october considering the period between august and october the outstanding of repurchase agreements increased from billion to the main factors driving the liquidity expansion in the period were the net expenses of the union and the net redemption of securities by the national treasury ipca inflation increased in after reaching in up from in totaling in the first nine months of compared to in the same period of last trailing inflation reached exceeding that of september the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which have increased more rapidly than regulated prices a reversal in the dynamics observed in the recent in market prices and regulated prices increased and in the year through and and in the last twelve despite the brl appreciation in amongst market the prices of tradable goods showed the sharpest in the twelve months through tradable goods inflation totaled up from observed in the same period of last whereas goods inflation reached up from in the same period of notwithstanding the recent occurrence of inflation developments less benign than previously price dynamics still indicates that inflation should continue to evolve according to the targets the recent dynamics of ipca core inflation measures has been in line with headline the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices elevated in august against in but decelerated in september smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures increased in august and against and in and decelerated in september and core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices shows stability in the year through september against in and in the last twelve months as well against in on its smoothed trimmed means core inflation decelerated both and on a trailing basis against and against trimmed means core inflation increased against in but retreated on a trailing basis against in it is noteworthy in all inflation stood below the central but shows which is relevant in the cases of the core inflation by exclusion and trimmed means relative to the record lows observed in previous the general price index inflation accelerated in august and in september relative to the previous as a in the year through inflation increased up from in the same period of last on a trailing inflation measured by totaled up from in this increase reflects not only the behavior of the consumer price which totaled up from but also of the whose variation totaled up from on its despite at higher inflation as measured by the civil construction national index showed stability in the last twelve months against in the same period of regarding wholesale price it is relevant to highlight that agricultural prices strongly reaching in the last twelve versus in the same period of industrial prices behaved positively in the recording down from in september of last but significantly accelerated in the augustseptember compared to the previous when had registered slight as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output grew in july and after increasing in confirming the solid expansion of this still considering the seasonally adjusted after the fall observed in the first decrease after nine consecutive positive industrial output resumed reaching in this expansion suggests that the retreat in industrial output in july was industrial output in august records a robust growth in the thirteenth consecutive expansion under this industrial output grew in and on a trailing showing acceleration at the still considering the last twelve months through manufacturing industry production reached while mining industry production expanded by for the leading and coincident indicators available point to the continuity of the industrial production expansion which will be favored by the several stimulus factors that influence economic including the monetary easing already among the use it bears emphasizing the strong monthly expansions of capital goods production and durable consumer goods which increased and in on a according to data seasonally adjusted by the in the strong increases in capital goods production and durable consumer goods production should also be the strength of durable consumer goods production the remarkable improvement in credit when compared to historical the accelerated expansion of capital goods production to a due to the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of domestic demand which has reflected both the improvement of income and the expansion of underpinned by the perception of higher macroeconomic it bears emphasizing the contribution of other specific such as investment resumption in the agricultural and live stock compared to august the production of the majority of industrial sectors surveyed out of expanded in with highlights to the increase in the production of machinery and equipment and vehicles labor market continues to present fairly positive the unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey stood at in unchanged the unemployment rate significantly decreased in the seventh consecutive fall according to this comparison so that in terms it stood below the observed in the same period of last the purchasing power of employed workers decreased in the third consecutive monthly it increased relative to the same month last and in the first eight months of the as a real payrolls expanded by in the year through compared to the same period of last a key driver for sustained aggregate demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in august and compared to august regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirm the continuity of strong in job creation grew seasonally adjusted expanding by in the year through september and in the last twelve with highlights to employment expansions in the construction industry and in the retail sector these figures corroborate the creation of million formal jobs in the year through september and million formal jobs in the last twelve in line with the positive developments in labor and with the expansion of retail sales continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and consistent signs of cooling cannot be in retail sales increased in the seventh consecutive according to data seasonally adjusted by the in the first seven months of relative to the same period of last retail sales grew by and in the last twelve by compared to the same month of retail sales increased by in according to the same comparison it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of furniture and domestic appliances and clothing and shoes these developments confirm the view expressed in previous copom minutes that both the expansion of income and the improvement of consumer credit conditions are crucially important to the strengthening of aggregate demand in expanded retail which include the sales of construction material and parts and grew by in compared to the same month of for the next it is expected the strengthening of retail further boosted by the increase in real payroll and credit and by the recovery of consumer which so far has not been affected by the higher volatility in financial the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in a record high for the series calculated by the the august result stood above the rate observed in the same month of recording the thirteenth consecutive expansion under this in the year through the average installed capacity utilization rate stood above the observed in the same period of and above the rate observed in the same period of and such increase economic activity acceleration and occurs in several despite the strong expansion of in in the year through the absorption of capital goods grew and reflects the significant increase in capital goods imports in as well as in capital goods production in the same the production of construction inputs increased the most recent data indicate that although investment has contributed to dampen the process of elevation of capacity utilization it has not been sufficient to avoid its persistence at relatively high which in the with periods of inflation in light of the recent behavior of capacity utilization the expansion of as well as the timely maturity of which may increase the productive capacity of will be fundamental to avoid relevant mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present robust performance in despite the deceleration at the confirming the evaluations reported in inflation reports and previous copom minutes about important structural changes in the brazilian foreign in the year through the trade surplus reached a decrease relative to the same period of exports rose to while imports increased to as stressed in previous copom imports have been growing more rapidly than due not only to the strengthening of the but and to the higher level of economic activity in the the current account surplus reached billion in the year through september and billion in the last twelve or of although the most intense effects of the crisis in the us subprime mortgages market over financial markets seem to have uncertainties on the one several volatility and risk aversion indicators improved significantly since the last copom on the other neither has the situation in the interbank markets of the mature economies reached nor have the developments of this crisis over real economy completely the magnitude of the crisis is not completely known especially the effects over the us economic growth to a lesser over the european notwithstanding the remaining difficulties in financial markets and the uncertainties regarding global economy the recovery in risk appetite has been relatively including that regarding brazilian in the price behavior of brazilian assets in the last episode of stress in international financial similarly to the observed in february and in march this and in may and june evidences the consolidation of international investors confidence in the brazilian the main central banks reacted to the financial turbulence providing liquidity in the interbank market in the case of easing the monetary policy aiming at minimizing the risk that the impact of the real state sector over credit would lead to a more pronounced economic on its inflation expectations in the us from financial slightly increased in the last reacting to the weakening of the us dollar the main currencies and to the upward trend in the prices of raw in the long monetary tightening cycle comes to an end in the and the current debate seems to be centered in the duration and magnitude of additional reductions in the interest in europe and in the major asian economic activity continues to record robust despite the increase in the risk of caused by the uncertainties regarding the us domestic macroeconomic the impact of difficulties of real state market over financial institutions and credit conditions in these in this it bears emphasizing that the current vigor of emerging economies has importantly counterbalanced the economic deceleration in the the brazilian does not seem to have significantly been impacted by the recent and should continue its growth essentially sustained by domestic in the upcoming oil a systematic source of international which remained at historically high levels in the last had important additional increase since the last copom this behavior reflects not only structural shifts in global energy but also geopolitical which recently despite the significant uncertainties surrounding the expectations about the future trend for oil the main scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in remains the prices of other commodities have also presented high volatility in the last driven by the heightened uncertainty about the prospects for global growth and by the turmoil on global the main raw material price indices have presented an upward trend in the last in this the strong acceleration of food prices in several countries should be which has made the control of inflation by several central banks a more difficult assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the september copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at the projections for electricity price adjustments in remained at the same considered in the september copom while the projections for fixed telephone price adjustments for the same year were modified to down from the projection for regulated prices inflation in was modified to down from considered in the september copom these according to the weights released by the represent of the total september the projection for regulated prices inflation in was also at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap estimates a bps under the benchmark in the fourth quarter of reaching bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the september copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group slightly decreased to down from this reduction was mainly driven by the addition of the september inflation below market ahead inflation expectations reached down from considering the composition of monthly inflation market for inflation expectations increased to up from projected on the eve of the last copom considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca decreased compared to the value considered at the september copom and remained below the target established by the cmn for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for remained stable compared to the value considered at the september copom and remain below the central target for the both the projections for based on the benchmark scenario and on the market scenario decreased compared to the value considered at the september copom and remain below the target established for monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the pace of demand expansion remains and may increase the probability of significant inflationary pressures on investment expansion and imports growth have contributed to retard this limiting potential inflationary effects stemming from aggregate demand sustained despite uncertainties regarding the continuity of strong growth in the international economy and the heightened volatility in global markets in the last the prospects for brazilian external financing in the forecast period according to the information available until that the balance of payments should not present a risk to the inflation on the other some recent evidences point to an intensification of the risks on the global inflation as suggested by the evolution of some raw materials although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets additional uncertainty surrounds this as in recent the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the the copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to domestic inflation trajectory has because the heated demand can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price although the external sector can restrain the pressures in the tradable the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the the copom also observes that even though the upward movement of ipca inflation expectations for has stabilized over the recent weeks at a level below the target established for this process must be carefully in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation discriminating between oneoff and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets for this to it is important that inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the committee once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts nor have the effects of the economic activity on inflation completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit growth and payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next quarters of the year and for the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have limited effects in and predominant impacts in the copom recognizes the contribution of enlarging the productive and of the external sector to mitigate inflationary but evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be sustained by factors such as the impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented this may bring risks to the inflationary aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom has privileged a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy that is the reason why variables such as inflation the balance of risks associated to the prospective scenario and the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so prudence assumes an even more important role in this like at the current when the deterioration of the balance of inflationary risks reduces the safety margin of the monetary under this considering the uncertainties associated with both the transmission mechanisms of the monetary policy and the prospective growth pace of aggregate supply and the copom decided to pause the monetary policy easing this decision aims to preserve the gains in inflation control and to ensure that the strengthening of economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid the committee unanimously decided to maintain the selic target rate at without under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine price prospective dynamics and its balance of domestic demand continues to expand economic activity this encompasses some sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already are still not fully in spite of not being an imminent threat to inflation the contribution of the external sector to the maintenance of a benign inflationary scenario may become less at a moment when the effects of investment over the productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on december for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased in down from in totaling increases of in the year through september and in the last twelve the ipca deceleration was mainly driven by the price behavior of food and which increased down from in contributing for the in comparison to in the previous health and personal care and clothes registered higher rates than in the previous it also bears emphasizing the downturn in the prices of mainly the decline in fixed telephone after a increase in market prices inflation increased in down from in while regulated prices inflation totaled down from in the same on a trailing market prices increased and regulated among market the prices of goods increased while the prices of tradable goods totaled according to the same comparison the several ipca core inflation measures declined on a basis and showed relative stability on a trailing the smoothed trimmed means core rose in down from in in the last twelve the change totaled against in the nonsmoothed trimmed means core reached down from in totaling in the last twelve months through up from in the last twelve months through the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in down from in totaling in the last twelve months through compared to in the ipca diffusion which indicates the proportion of items with positive change in the month stood at in compared to in august and in average the increased in down from in totaling in the year through september and in the last twelve considering the index the and the decelerated in while the incc the increased down from in reaching in the year through september and in twelve the inflation measured by the totaled in down from totaling in the year through september and in the last twelve the incc increased up from in reflecting the increase in the prices of materials and while the cost of labor was almost unchanged in the year through the incc increased and in the last twelve the lower change of in september was driven by the price deceleration in many mainly which increased in down from in the core inflation measure increased down from in totaling in the year through september and in the last twelve the deceleration of in september reflected the lower change in industrial and agricultural the agricultural ipa elevated down from in while the industrial prices increased from according to the same comparison the main drivers for upward agricultural price pressures in september were the prices of fruit and perishable milk and the deceleration in the agricultural ipa stemmed mainly from the prices of perishable milk and the downturn in the prices of bovines and the recurrent fall in the price of sugar compared to the previous among the prices of industrial it bears emphasizing the increase in the prices of mining industry products and fertilizers and the fall in the prices of economic activity according to monthly survey retail sales increased seasonally adjusted in among the activities included in the general only the sales of and food beverages and tobacco expanded on sales of vehicles and parts and which are not part of the general retail sales grew in the out of federation units reached positive results in retail sales expanded by in driven by increases in all its components mainly in furniture and home appliances and clothing and shoes expanded retail sales increased with highlights to the expansion in the sales of vehicles and parts and retail sales performance reflects the continuity of payroll growth and better credit together with the impacts of social programs and the recovery of the agricultural retail sales increased in the first seven months of compared to the same period of while expanded retail which include parts and pieces and construction increased by it bears emphasizing the increase in the sales of vehicles and furniture and domestic appliances in the same on a regional all states but piauí recorded growth in retail sales in with the most significant expansions in the northeastern and northern according to são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the the consultations to the usecheque system decreased by in while the database consultations for credit sales increased on a in the year through these indicators rose by and regarding investment construction inputs production and capital goods production increased seasonally adjusted and in while the imports of capital goods expanded by in the year through these indicators increased by and in the same considering the domestic production of capital goods during this it bears emphasizing the increases of in the production of capital goods for for for serial for construction and for industrial production increased in according to monthly industrial survey seasonally adjusted reaching a new record high in the historical series and evidencing the punctual aspect of the fall observed in industrial production rose by compared to august and expanded by in the year through august and in the last twelve considering seasonally adjusted manufacturing and extractive industry production increased and in the all use categories increased in the capital goods durable consumer goods intermediate goods and goods in the year through capital goods production leaded industrial increasing by followed by durable consumer goods production intermediate goods production and nondurable consumer goods production the disaggregated analysis of industrial activity showed in seventeen out of the activities with seasonally adjusted series with highlights to machines and and material and communication the main negative drivers stemmed from the decreases in the edition and printing sector and pharmaceutical still regarding the industrial according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the real industrial sales and hours worked in production increased and in in the year through these indicators increased by and compared to the same period of installed capacity utilization reached in up from in after seasonal considering observed installed capacity utilization reached in the above the august vehicles production reached thousand units in according to total production increased according to data seasonally adjusted by the and compared to the same month of considering the seasonally adjusted domestic sales and exports decreased and in compared to the data of the first nine months of vehicles production increased in and domestic while exports decreased still according to the production of agricultural machines and trucks increased and according to the same comparison reflecting the agricultural sector recovery and investments according to the september estimate for the grains harvest pointed to lower growth in compared to the august overall due to the reduction of around tons in corn estimate which exceeded the little increases in the forecasted production of other national production of grains and may reach million above the previous year due to good weather conditions and the production incentive stemming from the increase in the international prices of agricultural compared to the the most significant increases should occur in the production of wheat cottonseed corn and soy while the most prominent decreases should happen in the production of rice and beans and considering other agricultural in addition to the ibge pointed to a decrease in coffee production and a increase in surveys and expectations the monthly survey showed a increase in the consumer confidence index in among the two icc the current economic conditions index increased while the consumer expectation index decreased in for the ninth consecutive the icea remained above the compared to september the icc and the icea increased and while the iec decreased according to the fgv which encompasses two thousand homes in the seven main state capitals of the the icc remained almost stable in september points compared to points in this result was due to the combination of less favorable assessments regarding current situation and more optimistic expectations for the next compared to september the icc increased with expansions of in the current situation index and in the expectations still according to the the industry confidence index increased to in september up from in reaching a new record high of the series begun in april the ici increased compared to september and expanded by in the year through compared to the same period of among the ici issues related to the current the most significant increase in the last twelve months was due to the assessment on the demand mainly influenced by the domestic regarding the expectations for the next three of the companies foresee increase in personnel while forecast the installed capacity utilization reached in compared to in the same month of labor market according to the ministry of labor and thousand new formal jobs were created in a increase all the main sectors presented positive except for agriculture and live stock which reflected the period in the period of the after the seasonal adjustment of the the employment index in august increased in the year through million jobs were a elevation relative to the same period of with highlights to the higher volume of hirings in the services in relative it bears emphasizing the expansions of construction and manufacturing industries and according to the ibge employment survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment in remained at the stability of the unemployment rate reflected the increases of in employed population and in economically active population considering the population employed in the private there was a increase in the due to the expansion in the number of formal workers and the reduction in the number informal the number of employers increased while workers decreased in the year through the number of employed workers expanded mainly due to the increases of in the number of formal workers and in number of selfemployed according to the same real average earnings reached in decreasing compared to august real average earnings increased in the year through the expansion reached real the result of the average earnings times the number of occupied grew in the increasing by according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in in the year through this indicator expanded by while real manufacturing payroll raised credit and delinquency rates credit operations in the financial system reached billion in or of in the the expansion reached increasing in the year through august and in the last twelve earmarked credit operations increased in the month and in the last twelve while the nonearmarked ones expanded by and in the same among credit it bears emphasizing the trailing leasing operations due to the expansions of and in credit to individuals and credit to regarding earmarked the most significant expansions in the last twelve months are related to housing and the agricultural sector among agricultural sector credit although it still represents a small it bears emphasizing the growth in credit destined to cooperatives in this considering credit operations by economic loans to other services and commerce increased above the

the stress levels that characterized the operations in july and momentarily absorbing the exacerbations provoked by the crisis in the us subprime mortgage after the central banks interventions through open market providing short term funding in order to regulate the liquidity and reduce the interest rates it bears emphasizing the actuation of the federal reserve bank in its meeting on september in which the fed funds target was reduced for the first time since june the followed by the same cut in the rediscount contributed to the improvement of the financial conditions in several assets although there is no consensus about the intensity of this crisis effects over the us real economy over the global the recovery in the prices of commodities reinforces the uncertainties regarding inflationary pressures triggered by energy and food the recent falls in consumer confidence indexes already capture the feeling of these effects over consumption despite the current contraction of inflation in developed the central banks still worry about these inflationary risks and will gradually return to prioritize inflation combat in their monetary policies foreign trade and international reserves between january and september brazilian external trade confirmed the ongoing reaching record highs in exports and in the year through the trade surplus reached accumulating billion in the last twelve while the external trade totaled billion and in the same in the first two weeks of the trade balance reached with exports reaching billion average of and billion average of in exports reached reaching a million daily average above the observed in the same month of the exports of manufactured products totaled recording a million daily above the observed in the same month of the previous the exports of basic products totaled and of with respective increases of and in daily average which reached record levels for the three products imports totaled billion in with record daily average value of above the observed in the same month of all products categories expanded according to the same comparison fuels and lubricants capital goods consumer goods and raw materials and intermediate goods regarding this it bears emphasizing the acquisitions of primary food chemical and pharmaceutics and transportation equipment regarding the consumer goods the main increases were observed in vehicles imports clothing and amongst the imports of capital it bears emphasizing the acquisition of industrial machines and equipments for office and scientific and parts and pieces for capital international reserves totaled billion in with increases of billion in the month and billion in the money market and open market operations since the september copom the future interest rates especially in longer this movement was mainly due to the improvement in external financial markets conditions and the reduction in the risk after the federal open market committee decision to reduce the us economy basic interest rate by the brl appreciation also contributed to the interest rates decrease in the between september and october and rates and and rates decreased and real interest rates measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed twelvemonth ahead inflation expectations reduced to on october down from on september on september the bcb carried out reverse fx swap auctions amounting with the total rollover of the october in its open market the bcb carried from september to october weekly and long fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted borrowing and one lending overnight repo the bcb also conducted daily liquidity management operations with

working amounting billion and between september and october the national treasury raised a total of of which billion in billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and of which billion were settled in other national treasury in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in july and october and bought ltns or both maturing in january totaling the treasury also conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in and totaling receiving lfts maturing in as and to buy ltns and totaling billion and ipca after rising in the first four months of was zero in june and near zero in july as a inflation accumulated in the first seven months of reached largely mirroring the behavior of market which increased by in the same focusing on market whereas tradable goods showed some stability in the year through down from in the prices of goods increased up from in on its regulated prices increasing by in the same compared to in the same period of the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of shows some increase at the reaching in the year through july and in twelve in information available shows improvement in inflation the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed convergent behavior between june and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation decreased from in june to in and so did the double weight core inflation to and the core inflation by exclusion to in the year through the core inflation by exclusion increased by while smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation measures increased and despite the more favorable dynamics in the recent these changes and above the rates prevailing in the same period in the trailing inflation on its reached in july and for the core inflation by smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation still standing above the midpoint of the inflation after six months above the june ipca diffusion index retreated to retreating again in july the general price index inflation decreased from in june to in in the year through the inflation reached in the same period of under this comparison the acceleration of the reflected the behavior of its three the main the wholesale price index increased in through july in the same period of on its the consumer price index brazil increased in the same period in whereas the civil construction national index increased in the inflation under this comparison derived both from the behavior of agricultural and industrial the industrial ipa increased in the same period of and wholesale agricultural prices rose in it should be emphasized that the dynamics of wholesale prices particularly the agricultural the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to foreign and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the index of economic activity of the bcb incorporates estimates for monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for products taxes it constitutes an important coincident indicator of economic after registering growth for sixteen consecutive months until the was stable in may and the evolution of the as well as other indicators of suggests accommodation of the economy in the second in contrast to the fast pace observed in the first quarter of the outlook for second half of signals that the economy may but at a pace more consistent with rates evaluated as sustainable in the long according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after having retreated in the previous three the production increased in july down from in on a trailing after consecutive declines observed since february until march industrial production expanded in may and in the fourth consecutive on its on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output decreased in after decreasing in in the first months of this the strength of industrial activity was influenced by the international the and as well as by domestic financial which have boosted domestic this process was also supported by the rebuilding of inventories and the anticipation of on its partially resulted from the prospects of fiscal stimulus due to the fall in the comparison basis observed throughout the second the behavior of ibge industrial output series and its components continues close to that observed in the period prior to the industrial production should resume the upward being this process supported not only by traditional sources of but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial among other among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the most important drivers in july were durable consumer goods and intermediate goods increasing by in both and consumer goods production also increased whereas capital goods production decreased on a moving average while intermediate goods slightly increased the production of all other categories capital durable consumer and it bears highlighting that capital goods production expanded by in the year through the most remarkable expansion among the use evidencing the consistent recovery of the domestic after the the recovery in industrial production dynamism was initially led by the production of durable but it became widespread reflecting tax exemption in advanced process of as well as the easing in financial conditions and the income the future behavior of industrial production will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen which should continue to be sources of among other the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey decreased from in june to lower than that observed in the same month of last according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate remained stable in for the third consecutive after decreasing substantially after the the unemployment rate has shown some average real earnings increased in on its increased by in june and in with highlights for the industry as a real payroll expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that formal employment continues to in thousand jobs were created in july and in the first seven months of registering the third best level for july and a record high for job creation in the first seven months of the year for the historical which begun in the manufacturing services and civil construction registered the largest balances accumulated since the most dynamic sector for formal employment continues to be civil where employment expanded in the first seven months of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales remained stable in after decreasing by in may and in on a the indicator increased in the moving average of expanded retail sales for the quarter ended in june decreased as compared to the quarter ended in according to seasonally adjusted on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the office material and equipment other items for personal and domestic use and supermarkets and food products despite the stability shown at the in the next months it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by governmental by real payroll by credit expansion and by consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in standing near the levels registered prior to the according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci decreased to in june in according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reached in august in the previous among the four use the nuci in consumer goods industry versus in the previous and in construction inputs versus in the previous decreased in on its the nuci for capital goods increased while the nuci for the intermediate goods industry remained stable as compared to the previous month the reduced idleness capacity is the result of economic activity still not totally offset by the maturity of investment data regarding the absorption of capital goods show recovery the absorption of capital goods decreased in seasonally and increased in the year through growth reached the production of construction inputs reduced in according to observed it increased in accumulating a growth in twelve in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have accommodated at high as stressed in previous the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance reached a billion surplus in billion lower than the obtained in the same period last this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade the behavior of remittances of profits and dividends contributed to elevate the trailing current account which reached billion in equivalent to of up from billion in on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of the global economy recovery continues to be led by emerging but since the last copom meeting evidences have accumulated signaling that this process may be less intense than previously in a scenario where the observation of dynamism in the economies europe and for becomes less the us economy shows signs of evidencing that the current recovery should unfold at a pace slower than previously and the possibility of a reversion may not be in consumer confidence remains at levels below those prevailing prior to the and unemployment remains at a high with prospects of slow retreat in the next on its the japanese economy continues to grow at a noticeable slow the recovery in the euro area is besides being slow and uneven across its partly due to the fiscal consolidation and the difficulties experienced by the credit on the other german the most important in the euro shows some signs of in the uncertainty regarding the sustainability and pace of economic expansion in mature economies mainly in the us and in a scenario where economic policy stimuli are replaced by contraction as the economies show high idleness for the production a process exacerbated by fiscal central banks maintain the accommodative monetary policy in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy continues unchanged in several but in those economies that were less impacted by the which recovered more quickly and and that adopted more restrictive monetary policy some accommodation has been since the last copom oil prices have decreased in the spot market and have increased in future volatility has and the uncertainty concerning the quotations has remained as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in a context of asymmetric global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices might affect the domestic economy both through production such as the and through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact on the evolution of food have increased since the previous copom with highlights for wheat and on their industrial commodity prices also increased in the same of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustment for fixed telephone was kept at for while the projected adjustment for electricity prices increased from to for the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was maintained at unchanged relative to the july according to the benchmark this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total july the projection for regulated prices inflation for was maintained at on the benchmark such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be reduced by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refers to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca decreased from to for the median of inflation expectations increased from to the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation decreased relative to the figure considered at the july copom but continues to be above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also but it still continues above the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection decreased relative to the figure considered at the july copom and it is now around the inflation midpoint under the market the projection also and is positioned around the midpoint regarding the first half of the projection decreased under the benchmark although the contrary movement was observed under the market but under both scenarios the projection is around the inflation midpoint policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom confirms that under the it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the price the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary and help the process of coordination of economic mainly price it is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation targets stands at advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last six at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the fx and inflationary risk premium among other seem to have resulted in significant reduction of the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has increased in the last despite recognizing that a high degree of uncertainty surrounds the calculation of the copom considers that the most pessimist estimates regarding the current level of neutral interest rate with significant not to find support in the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy in international risk aversion and volatility have remained high since the last copom liquidity remains although the perception of systemic risk shows cooling concerns about european countries sovereign debt and the deceleration in china remain while the worries regarding the sustainability of the us economy recovery even the prices of some commodities and brazilian assets increased prospects for external funding for the brazilian economy remain the trajectory of price indices evidences the cooling of inflationary pressures in some relevant whereas prospects of deflation in other economies in this the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation remains although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook the copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain at a less intense rhythm than the observed at the start of the as evidenced by data on inventories and industrial among this assessment is supported by signs of a more moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high but with some accommodation at the and by the recent trajectory of inventories in some industrial the copom on the other that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be among other by the vigor of labor by the remaining effects of fiscal impulses and of policies of public banks at a magnitude lower than previously by the global the copom considers important to once that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current and past inflation the prospective scenario substantially deteriorated early this a dynamic that has reversed more clearly since the last greatly mirroring less favorable prospects for global activity and the monetary policy actions implemented this this assessment finds for in the significant reduction of projections for the selic without resulting in unfavorable changes in the median of inflation in have substantially reduced for and increased only marginally for regarding the forwardlooking it is fundamental to highlight that there was retreat in the values projected for inflation by the despite recognizing the existence of risks of inflation increase in the short the copom considers that the convergence of inflation to the midpoint target tends to for it finds support in the pertinent consideration that monetary policy acts with time lags over activity and and that the effects of the adjustment process in the basic interest rate initiated in april completely on the other the committee ensures in case this scenario does not promptly the monetary policy stance should be adjusted in order to guarantee the convergence between the pace of demand and supply from another in case inflation does not promptly converge to the midpoint target established by the monetary policy should act in order to redirect price dynamics ensure the target to be the intensity and frequency of shocks that both the global and brazilian economies have undergone in recent years impose additional challenges to the analysis of the prospective the committee recognizes an economic environment where uncertainty stands above the usual and the remaining risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem from the domestic for it bears highlighting those deriving from domestic demand in a context of narrow idleness margin in the use of production evidences of this fact come from the real wages gains in some segments and higher pressures on production prices in the recent it is plausible to that the factors that support these domestic risks have for there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to equilibrium the effects of demand pressures and the high level of utilization of the factors on the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool in since the last the risks to the materialization of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation targets have partially due to the reversion of substantial part of stimuli introduced during the international financial crisis of in to the basic rate adjustment implemented since another contributing factor for in the same was the higher probability of and even of the already slow process of recovery of as a the influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation behavior shows a disinflationary under these the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without while the copom does not expect the inflation level recorded in the last months to be kept in the near it observes the continuation of the process of risk reduction for the inflationary scenario unfolding since the june copom in this the committee judges at this the maintenance of the basic interest rate at the level set in the july meeting provides adequate conditions to ensure the convergence of inflation to the targets domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although they tend to fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and still should contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness margin of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial by those referring to the significant worsening of the global economy prospects and especially by those stemming from the monetary policy stance these elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on october for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the changed in up from in increasing in the year and in twelve the performance in the month reflected mainly the contribution of the group food and beverages which changed the diffusion index reached up from in the monthly change of the reflected the impact of the deceleration in regulated which increased in down from in related to market the prices of tradable goods showed lower retreat up from while the prices of goods registered a reversal in the downward trend up from in the same market prices rose in the last twelve months through reflecting the increases in the prices of tradable goods and goods whilst regulated prices grew it can be emphasized according to this comparison all segments relative to the three core inflation measures cooled down in core inflation by exclusion increased in down from in totaling in twelve the smoothed core inflation reached down from in accumulating in twelve while the double weight core inflation increased down from in totaling in twelve the ipca changed in after showing stability in in the first seven months of the the ipca totaled on a trailing the ipca rose in down from in june and in the ipca in july reflected impacts in opposite directions of the trajectories of regulated prices up from in and market prices down from in which were mainly influenced by the change in the prices of tradable goods down from in the ipca segmentation shows that the stability in the last two months stemmed mainly from the decreases in the prices of food and which have offset the positive contributions of the other despite the stability of the last two it should be noted that the decrease in the prices of food and beverages in the period cooled which can affect the pattern of the index in the next the diffusion index reached down from in the three ipca core inflation measures in the smoothed core inflation measure reached in down from in totaling and in the last twelve months through july and through core inflation by which excludes ten items of household food and grew in down from in totaling and in the last twelve months through july and through the double weight core inflation increased in down from in totaling and in the last twelve months through july and through the increased in up from in totaling in the year and in twelve the wholesale price index increased by in up from in reflecting the acceleration both in industrial prices up from and in the prices of agricultural products up from in the last twelve months through the ipa rose reflecting respective increases of and observed in the prices of industrial and agricultural the changed in down from in totaling in twelve the incc increased in down from in totaling in twelve activity the showed stability in considering seasonally adjusted after increasing by in the indicator showed relative stability in the subsequent for the quarter ended in the average increased down from for the quarter ended in according to observed for the quarter ended in the expanded by totaling in the year and in twelve expanded retail sales remained stable in after decreasing by in may and by in according to seasonally adjusted data by the monthly survey according to seasonally adjusted sales decreased in five of the ten sectors with highlights for the following negative construction inputs magazines and stationery and fuels and lubricants on the other sales of office equipment and material grew by followed by other items of personal and domestic use and supermarkets and food products for the quarter ended in retail sales fell by compared to the quarter ended in retail sales grew in accumulating increases of in the year and in the last twelve among the segments of only vehicles and parts and pieces retracted among the segments that it bears noticing the rise in sales of office material and equipment and furniture and appliances in the sales increased for all especially those regarding office material and equipment and furniture and appliances expanded retail sales in the last twelve months through relative to the last twelve months through also shows generalized increase by with highlights to the rise in office material and equipment and vehicles and parts and pieces the number of consultations to the central credit protection service and to the usecheque system recorded respective declines of and in according to seasonally adjusted data from the commercial association of sao paulo covering the state considering observed these indicators recorded respective increases of and in the first seven months of the automobile sales by including light commercial trucks and rose in according to fenabrave federation of automotive vehicles seasonally adjusted by the it bears highlighting the sales of cars and which and total sales increased with highlights for trucks and light commercial vehicles while cars sales remained almost stable in the year and in the last twelve months through automobile sales increased respectively and driven by higher increases in all especially buses and light commercial capital goods imports increased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the indicator rose while in the year and on a twelvemonth trailing it increased and compared to the same

indicators of economic activity released since the last copom meeting remains consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short evidence suggests a gradual recovery of economic activity during the course of the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment the global outlook remains quite developments have so far mitigated the effects on the brazilian economy of possible changes in economic policy in some large notably in the united there is uncertainty regarding the sustainability of global economic growth and the stability of current commodity price returning to the domestic inflation dynamics remain the disinflation process has become more widespread and the disinflation of the ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary policy has increasing confidence that the ongoing disinflation process will have lasting food price disinflation constitutes a favorable supply inflation expectations for collected by the focus survey are around expectations for remain around and expectations for and longer horizons are slightly below that the path of administered which enters the conditional forecasts for the inflation scenarios produced by the assumes increases of for and for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rates of per annum at the end of the same under these the inflation forecast for retreated relative to the one reported in the february copom minutes unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the february copom meeting to around the forecast for in this scenario remained around risks around baseline inflation scenario the highly uncertain global outlook might make disinflation more the next steps in the process of approval of fiscal reforms involve the consideration of reforms that are fundamental to the fiscal such as the social security this process may be lengthy and involves these reforms and other necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy are important for the sustainability of disinflation and for the reduction of its structural interest disinflation in food prices constitutes a favorable supply which might produce contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and inflation in other sectors of the economic activity points to stabilization in the short but its recovery might be more gradual and delayed than currently discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic in light of available they all agreed that there are signs consistent with stabilization of the economy in the short the prospective assessment of the committee is that there is a small improvement in the outlook for economic compared to the copom meeting in february the challenges for the resumption of economic activity and the committee expects the economic recovery during the course of to be regarding the global the committee members pointed out the uncertainties associated with possible changes in economic policy in the united with the sustainability of global economic with the stability of current commodity price levels and also with the outlook for bank of brazil chinese they believe that the brazilian economy nowadays shows greater capacity to respond to occasional negative developments in the global due to the progress in the disinflationary process and in the anchoring of all committee members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved in a favorable way since the last copom meeting in february to a large in line with they analyzed the inflation trajectory during this and the following considering the scenario that conditions on paths of the interest rate and exchange rate extracted from the focus projections for inflation remain below the target throughout projections reach a trough in the third quarter of the year and increase in the last months of the year to values still below this difference can be partially attributed to the primary effects of the favorable food price still under the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus the inflation trajectory reaches the target in the copom members discussed the impacts of the revision of the tariff surcharge related to angra iii nuclear power plant over inflation in the short this revision may decrease april ipca inflation by around but the return of the tariff to a level similar to the previous one should produce an opposite effect of similar magnitude in may ipca residual impact in all members concluded that such and unusual fluctuations do not have relevant implications for the conduct of monetary the copom members assessed the extension of the monetary easing including its implications for the level of the policy rate throughout the extension will depend on the evolution of economic on the other aforementioned risk on the projections and expectations of ipca inflation for and and also on the estimates for the structural interest rate of brazilian these estimates naturally involve uncertainty and may be reassessed by the committee over the committee members reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation with inflation forecasts at the target for and a little below target for and with the high level of economic the baseline scenario prescribes frontloading the monetary easing regarding the pace of monetary easing over the the committee understands for a given of its a possible acceleration of the pace is equivalent to greater frontloading of the all members of the copom agreed that the evolution of the economy since the february copom meeting is compatible with the reduction of the selic rate to percent everyone also agreed that this moderate intensification of the pace of monetary easing relative to the pace set in the january and february meetings at this the members of the committee discussed the next steps for monetary they at the the fundamental condition that any future decision should be compatible with the maintenance of inflation projections at the target over the relevant and with anchored inflation they also on the one how monetary policy could contribute to the stabilization process and subsequent resumption of economic activity on the other the lagged effects that monetary policy could have on inflation for the coming the committee members pondered over the degree of frontloading of the desired on the one they argued that the evolution of the economic outlook would already allow monetary easing at a faster pace than the one decided at this on the other copom members also argued that given the nature of monetary the continuity of uncertainties and risk factors that still hover over the economy would make it more appropriate to maintain the pace set at this the committee members once again emphasized that the environment with anchored inflation expectations would allow the copom to focus on preventing effects of relative price adjustments that may occur over this applies to the favorable food supply the copom understands that the primary effects of this supply to which monetary policy should not should be estimated taking into account demand conditions in that monetary policy focus on possible effects of this which might contribute to additional reductions of inflation expectations and of inflation in other sectors of the all members of the committee emphasized that the approval and implementation of notably those of a fiscal and of adjustments in the brazilian including those related to credit policy and of are fundamental to the sustainability of to the full operation of monetary policy and to the bank of brazil of its structural interest with widespread benefits for the committee members highlighted the importance of other reforms and investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvement of the business these efforts are fundamental for the stabilization and resumption of the economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and a wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by one percentage to percent per without this moderate intensification of the pace of monetary relative to the pace set in the january and february copom at this the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes with a gradually increasing is compatible with the ongoing monetary easing the copom judges that the extension of the monetary easing cycle will depend not only on estimates of the structural interest rate of the brazilian which the committee will continue to reassess over but also on the evolution of economic on the other aforementioned risk and on inflation forecasts and the copom emphasizes that the pace of monetary easing will depend on the estimated extension of the cycle and on the degree of in the latter will depend on the evolution of economic on the other aforementioned risk and on inflation forecasts and the committee considers the current pace of easing to be the current economic context calls for monitoring the developments of the determinants of the degree of frontloading of the the following members of the

extended consumer price index reached in percentage points above the one recorded in the previous as a inflation accumulated in months reached in march in march market prices changed in march and regulated in march specifically among market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months through march in march and the prices of in march it bears noticing that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in in twelve months through march in march and the prices of services rose in march in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services sector in the short the realignment process of regulated the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in february to in as a on a trailing average core inflation above the one registered in march the double weight core inflation changed from in february to in the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from

index stood at in march above the one recorded in march the general price index increased in reaching on a trailing basis in march the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in march with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through march in march the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in march partially driven by pressures stemming from labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in february the

goods and in the services the industry confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation decreased in while the consumer confidence index and the services confidence index decreased and reaching the record lows for their respective historical regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the ibge in march indicated that the grains production was expected to grow by in relative to the the industrial activity decreased in after increasing in according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the the industrial production accumulates a change of in the last twelve months until according to the observed industrial production decreased in the result was negative in the four use categories and in out of the surveyed according to the same comparison according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased between january and according to the seasonally adjusted and it stood lower than the one observed in february the pmi of the industrial on its decreased from in february to in among the use according to the february and seasonally adjusted data the production of capital goods recorded the most significant decrease followed by semidurable and consumer goods durable consumer goods and intermediate goods regarding there was a decrease in the production of the four durable consumer goods capital goods semidurable and consumer goods and intermediate goods according to the continuous national household sample survey the unemployment rate in the moving quarter ended in february was estimated at representing an increase of compared to the same quarter of on its according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate reached in the figure represents increases of compared to february and of compared to march data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were created in thousand formal jobs were destroyed in the first quarter of this in the set of available data indicates the beginning of a process of distention in the labor according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume decreased in on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction fell in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the retail sales growth rate reached and the broad retail sales growth stood at with retraction in six out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the underperformed in by recording a fall the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by the governmental by the pace of the real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in march according to the seasonally adjusted among the industry use according to the seasonally adjusted the ones showing the highest nuci are construction material and intermediate goods followed by consumer goods capital goods and durable consumer goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve

march on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators in the relevant horizon for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced economies and at relatively high levels in the emerging the price of the brent oil barrel has increased since the previous copom reaching levels close to it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have retreated while the prices of metal commodities have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations retreated in the twelve months through march of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated the projected inflation for stands at up from considered at the march copom among other this projection considers the assumption of changes of in the price of gasoline and in the price of bottled of in fixed telephone and of in electricity the items for which there is more information available were projected for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for up from considered at the march on the baseline the estimated path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap is basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at billions in and of the gdp in it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse is equivalent to the change of the structural surplus compared to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca has changed from to for from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation remained stable compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the target established by the national monetary council in the the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also remained close to the value considered at the march meeting and remains above the inflation for according to the baseline the inflation forecast remained but increased in the market in both it remains above the target established by the policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in this the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the a more intense global activity trend prevails throughout the monetary policy relevant in this the prospects indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition and of moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights evidence of volatility sources in the currency markets and moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom notices that the available indicators regarding domestic absorption and gdp growth rates have converged and that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the in the investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of for the after a necessary period of the activity expansion pace tends to as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal the committee argues during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections will contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also highlights that this primary path will strengthen the perception of sustainability of the public sector it contributes to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in stimulating private investment in the medium and long specifically regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which is already being important to highlight the fact after years of strong the consumer credit has so over the last it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by the recently implemented the committee considers as necessary the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the as anticipated by previous the copom highlights that the narrow idleness margin in the labor market has eased at the with some data indicating the start of a process of distension in this the copom notices that it is necessary to broaden the horizon of and that a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity with negative impacts over in spite of the concession of adjustments for the minimum wage not so and the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers since its last these relative prices ajustments in the among other have made the balance of risks to inflation unfavorable this in this and as anticipated in previous these price adjustments cause inflation to rise in the short term and to tend to remain high in while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts on the committee reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from in order to limit them to given the assessing the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic rate by to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson otávio ribeiro sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to due to factors such as income and on the other the real state the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the for the the combined effects of these and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market this the dynamics of recovery of regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by at the end of the copom believes that the convergence scenario of inflation to at the end of has for the the progress made in the fight against inflation like benign signals stemming from the medium and long term expectations indicators has not been sufficient in this the copom reaffirms that the monetary policy should remain at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on june for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june after recording in monthly inflation measured by the ipca reached in as a inflation through september reached in above inflation registered in the same period of the inflation elevation in this period reflected the behavior of both market which increased in the twelve months through september regulated which increased in the same period of regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached while inflation related to goods increased services price inflation continues at high with monthly growth of in august and in increasing the accumulated inflation to the highest level since september in the set of available information suggests some persistence in the increase of process led by market in reflects the fact that services inflation remains at high the underlying inflation measures calculated by the in showed similar trend to that of headline as that there was an increase in the average of monthly changes and in accumulated the smoothed trimmed means core inflation

from in august and in the general price index inflation registered inflation of in up from in in the twelve months through the change reached below the registered in september under this the index has been slowing down since december when it recorded inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in twelve months through reflecting an increase of in the industrial ipa and of in the agricultural the breakdown according to the production phase shows that raw material prices accumulated while the prices of intermediate goods and final goods increased and according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through september above the recorded in according to the same comparison the civil

billion in equivalent to and in the last twelve months through the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months increased from billion in july to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding largely the needs for external global economy faces a period of uncertainty far above the with significant deterioration in growth prospects in advanced countries and moderation of activity in emerging in this risks to global financial of fiscal and financial among other due to exposure of international banks to sovereign debt of countries with fiscal especially in the euro in this since the last copom there was deterioration in the sovereign and banking debt it should be noted that the levels of risk aversion for those measured by credit default swaps of banks in the euro area are now comparable to those observed during the from another high persistent unemployment coupled with the need for fiscal as well as limited scope for monetary policy have contributed for the reduction of growth projections in advanced countries or even of their potential indicating a wider and more volatile business in the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for reinforced the signs of inflection in the main with prospects of lower growth for this and the next and in some of disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for related to activity in industry and in the services in consistent with this there has also been reduction in growth projections for major emerging regarding monetary mature economies have continued to adopt accommodative monetary in specific with new initiatives in the field of monetary regarding the core measures have persisted at moderate levels in the euro area and with a marginal deterioration in the euro area and in the in emerging in the bias of monetary policy is the price of brent oil barrel has shown but remained above this price level is consistent with a framework of global demand coupled with high political instability in some producer countries and with lags in the process of resuming it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the significant drop in the international prices of the ones related to agriculture and the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers accumulated decrease of since the peak in february in recent the high volatility observed in commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of growth and to volatility in fx of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline prices accumulated in was increased to up from considered in the august copom the adjustments for bottled gas prices accumulated in up to september was increased to compared to considered in the august copom the projected adjustment for fixed telephone and electricity accumulated in were kept unchanged at and the same values considered in the august the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark increased to up from considered in the august this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total september the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark was increased to up from considered in the august such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target around of without in a primary surplus of around of gdp is considered for and without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements changes announced in december since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca was increased from to for the median of inflation expectations were increased from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians for the ipca changed from and to and for the medians changed from and to and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the august copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projections increased in both the benchmark and the market and stand above the midpoint of the target in both for projected inflation stands around the midpoint of the target in the benchmark scenario and in the market in the main scenario considered by the projected inflation stands around the midpoint of the target in this scenario was developed and analyzed from the perspective of models that broadly identify the transmission mechanisms of external developments to the brazilian economy among the channels of the price of imports and the external as a working it considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the brazilian economy equivalent to one quarter of the impact observed during the international it assumes that the current deterioration of the international scenario is more persistent than the one verified in but less without observance of extreme according to this main domestic economic activity moderates and commodities prices in international markets and the exchange rate show some stability among other even with a moderate adjustment in the basic interest rate the inflation rate in the relevant horizon stands around the target in at a level below the one that would be observed if the above mentioned effect of the international crisis were not policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increas in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for houseeholds and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the inflation targeting regime maturing process stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the reduction of both fx and inflationary risk among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has been increasing in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the monetary policy traction increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy the copom considers since the last the risks to global financial stability have increased and thus contributed to the continuous process of deterioration of the international scenario already at that faced generalized and significant growth projections reductions for the main economic the committee understands that the chances that the restrictions to which several mature economies are now exposed extend for a period longer than previously anticipated remain it also notes in these there seems to be limited scope for using monetary and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in for the main emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in a consequence of policy actions and weakening external demand through the trade the committee considers that the international scenario shows disinflationary bias for the relevant for the there has been accumulated evidence supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy can be realized through many among the reduction of total trade the moderation in investment tighter credit conditions and the worsening in consumer and business the committee understands that the complexity surrounding the international environment will contribute to intensify and accelerate the ongoing moderation in domestic which is already for in the retreat of growth projections for the brazilian economy this year and in the upcoming in other the ongoing moderation process of the economy a result of the policy actions implemented since the end of last year tends to be boosted by the weakness of the global the copom evaluates although ongoing moderation of domestic demand growth is prospects for economic activity are still this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that confidence stands at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the the copom that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that accumulated inflation in the twelve months peaked in the last and it begins to retreat in the current moving towards the target the committee evaluates by this reversion of trend will contribute to improve the expectations of economic agents about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming especially those of the price the committee believes that this improved perception will be boosted by the ongoing process of reassessment of the pace of both domestic and external economic in this and in the upcoming the copom reaffirms that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the trend in the reduction of the public it bears highlighting since the beginning of this important decisions have been taken and which reinforce the view that a fiscal consolidation process is the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit market for which macroprudential and conventional monetary policy actions recently adopted still about the credit the committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates at the start of the inflation was strongly and negatively impacted by domestic and external supply as well as by the atypical concentration of regulated prices although in decreasing these developments should also indirectly impact the dynamics of consumer through among other at the same it as despite the risks stemming from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite signs of moderation in this considers that in such a very important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and from its negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has retreated and is below the longterm or is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain price the committee also observes at the end of last year and at the start of this the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory were key to the prospective since april these prices have retreated in international in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level and evaluates that since the last the inflation prospective scenario has shown favorable the copom notes according to the main the inflation rate stands around the target in and identifies decreasing risks to the confirmation of a scenario in which inflation timely converges to the midpoint in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom unanimously decided to decrease the selic target to without domestic demand is still especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector other important factors to curb domestic demand are the substantial deterioration of the international scenario and the macroprudential actions these elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom believes that by promptly mitigating the effects stemming from a more restrictive global moderate adjustments in the level of the basic rate are consistent with the scenario of inflation convergence to the target in at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on november for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in up from in according to ibge in the the ipca increased compared to in the same period last in the last twelve months through the index increased compared to in the monthly result for ipca was boosted by the acceleration in the segment of regulated which changed by in

the release of data signaling accommodation in the activity regarding the external the increase in uncertainties stemming from the developments of european countries debt the release of economic indicators weaker than expected in the main economies and the reduction in commodities prices also contributed to the fall in interest between august and october and interest rates decreased and while

arising from the global recovery after the pandemic period have intensified due to the increase of commodity prices in more by the new wave of in which might potentially extend even further the process of normalization in the supply of industrial the reorganization of global production already fueled by the war in is expected to with the search for a greater regional arrangement of the supply of in these developments might have consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures on global production of central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a more contractionary stance against increased in most of these current interest rates are still at levels evaluated as because of the potential persistence of the inflationary the repricing of monetary policy in advanced countries has impacted financial conditions in emerging the committee has also discussed the growing risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary turning to the brazilian the set of indicators released since the previous copom meeting suggests a rate of growth in line with the the labor market is still on a recovery and the latest trade and industry indicators have consumer inflation remains with increases spread among several and continues to be more persistent than whereas inflation of services and industrial goods are still the recent shocks have led to a strong increase in the components associated with food and recent readings were higher than and the surprise came on both the more volatile components and the items associated with core as for the more volatile the increase of gasoline prices is still with greater and faster impact than the inflation of the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy continues and the various measures of core inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and scenarios and risk in the reference the interest rate path is extracted from the focus survey selic rate rises to in and decreases to in and the exchange rate starts at and evolves according to the purchasing power parity the committee decided to keep the assumption that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve until the end of ending the year at usd and then start increasing per year in january the energy flag is assumed to be in december of and in this inflation projections stand at for and for inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than the committee opened its debate about the risks regarding its projections by discussing some of the likely explanations for the difference between the projection in its reference scenario and the some members emphasized that high current inflation has contaminated expectations beyond what was some additional likely explanations have been discussed through the analysis of alternative copom analyzed the impact of a slower reversion in industrial goods due to successive shocks on global production in copom also observed that different assumptions about the neutral interest rate have an impact on its albeit modest at the relevant inflationary impacts stemming from different assumptions about the convergence between the prices of oil and its have also seemed in what regards the global inflationary copom assessed that inflationary pressures have intensified and are characterized by both a persistently high demand for goods in the and supply shocks associated with the war in ukraine and the chinese policy to fight these factors might potentially generate persistent inflationary pressures in several particularly in those countries with more lagged normalization processes of fiscal and monetary the committee evaluated that there is still high uncertainty about the prospective trajectory of commodity prices in local because of the war in ukraine and the economic recovery in the copom assesses that there is a possibility of even if of the increase in international commodities measured in local the committee has debated the fiscal risk and how it affects the conduct of monetary uncertainties regarding the future of the current fiscal framework result in increased risk premia and raises the risk of a deanchoring of inflation this movement is already to some and is already partially incorporated in the inflation expectations extracted from the focus as well as in the prices of several domestic the committee emphasized that the appropriate level of monetary tightening is also dependent on the prevailing fiscal weaknesses in the structural reform as well as permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the neutral interest the committee evaluated the risks around the reference scenario for economic growth in and the committee highlighted that economic growth came in line with but the tightening of financial conditions brings a risk of deceleration in the quarters when its impacts tend to be more the committee emphasizes that risks to its inflation scenarios remain in both among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary and an increase in the risk premium due to the uncertainty about the future fiscal partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset among the downside it should be noted a possible even if of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local and a greater deceleration of economic activity than the committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the discussion about the conduct of monetary copom discussed the conduct of monetary considering the set of projections as well as the balance of risks for copom opened the discussion by evaluating the adjustment cycle carried out up to this it was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and due to monetary policy much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be copom noted that an additional deterioration was observed in both the inflationary dynamics and the even though the scenario is characterized by higher than usual uncertainty and copom then debated the monetary policy options for this the committee concluded that a further adjustment of percentage point was copom members then discussed how to signal the future monetary the committee opted to as an extension of the with an adjustment of lower magnitude in the next this strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant projection as well as the anchoring of inflation while reflects the already implemented monetary reinforces the cautious monetary policy stance and emphasizes the uncertain monetary policy taking into account the assessed the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective an even variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the convergence of inflation to its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary which includes without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into an even more restrictive the committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets for its next the committee foresees as likely an extension of the with an adjustment of lower the committee stresses that the heightened uncertainty of the current the advanced stage of the current monetary policy and its impacts yet to be observed require additional caution in its the copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation expectations and projections for the relevant horizon for monetary the following members of the committee voted for this roberto de oliveira

transportation sector in may makes it more difficult to assess the recent evolution of economic april data suggest more consistent activity relative to previous indicators for may and possibly june are likely to reflect the effects of the aforementioned the baseline scenario entertains continuation of recovery of economic activity in the brazilian at a more gradual economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook remained more challenging and showed the evolution of risks to a large with normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies led to adjustments in international financial as a risk appetite towards emerging economies has the short inflation should reflect significant temporary upward pressures stemming from the halt in the transportation sector and from other relative price measures of underlying inflation are still running at low this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and expectations for are around inflation projections in

for risks around baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risks factors in both the one the possible through inertial of low inflation levels in the past may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of further changes in the global outlook for emerging the latter risk has intensified since the previous copom whereas the risk that inflation would remain significantly below target over the relevant horizon has discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available april data suggest more consistent activity relative to previous the temporary halt in the transportation sector in makes it more difficult to assess the recent evolution of economic indicators for may and possibly june are likely to reflect the effects of the aforementioned economic developments over july and august should indicate more clearly the pace of which may be more or less the baseline scenario entertains the continuation of recovery of economic activity in the brazilian albeit at a more gradual pace than estimated prior to the regarding the global the committee considered that the scenario remains more the baseline scenario comprises gradual normalization of monetary policy in central there is risk of larger impacts on emerging value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom bank of copom to this which may reinforce changes in asset prices and volatility of financial conditions in international the committee members also mentioned the growing risks to the continued expansion of international with possible impacts on global in this the copom members once again highlighted the economy capacity to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospects of economic the copom pondered the risks stemming from a possible additional deterioration in the outlook for emerging in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout the current and subsequent all members agreed that in the inflation should reflect significant upward pressures stemming from the halt in the transportation sector and from other relative price the baseline scenario anticipates that those effects should be resulting from relative prices changes related to the aforementioned the committee pointed out that several measures of underlying inflation were running at low levels in the recent past and that relative prices changes in a context of anchored inflation expectations may accelerate the convergence of inflation to without posing risks to its favorable dynamics once these price changes are the members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms along with the anchoring of inflation expectations should be the committee reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation in the face of occasional shocks that lead to changes in relative monetary policy should focus on their round effects the copom also highlighted that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be monetary policy will follow the same whether in the face of inflationary shocks in the case of an external shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange or in the face of disinflationary shocks in the case of a favorable food price the committee emphasizes that this prescription requires an environment with anchored established how monetary policy should react to shocks that induce changes in relative copom members discussed the extent of the in the brazilian they concluded that the intensity of depends on several such as the level of the economy and the degree of anchoring of inflation the committee will monitor the different measures of to both inflation and underlying the copom members reaffirmed their understanding that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at low inflation projections slightly below target for and and high level of slack in the economy prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural interest although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of committee members expressed the view that current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the copom stresses that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over the committee members then discussed the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its may meeting and the appropriate monetary policy decision in light of such the effects of the halt in the transportation sector over the scenario were assessed by the it was agreed that the baseline scenario encompasses significant temporary effects of this shock on inflation and economic activity and that the assessment of incoming data will be contaminated by these the committee discussed possible enduring effects of the shocks faced by the brazilian the members agreed that in the short term it will be more difficult to evaluate if the developments of the economy are in line with its baseline scenario for the medium and long this context reinforces the importance of monitoring over time the evolution of the baseline scenario and its risks and of evaluating the duration of the effects of shocks on inflation its in order to ensure that the achievement of low inflation even in the face of adverse regarding the balance of on the one the committee judged that downward risks for the prospective inflation due to the low level of inflation in the recent have on the other it discussed the importance of the continuation of the process of adjustments and reforms in the brazilian economy for mitigating the risks associated with the deterioration of the scenario for emerging in a context of frustration of the expectations about these reforms and bank of copom based on all the copom members agreed to maintain the selic rate at as for the next considering the high level of uncertainty of the current the committee deems it appropriate to refrain from signaling the next steps in the conduct of the monetary the copom members reiterated the importance of reaffirming the conduct of monetary policy with exclusive focus on the evolution of inflation projections and the balance of and economic relative price shocks should be tackled only in the secondary impact they may have on prospective in they reiterated the importance of insisting on communicating that there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary the committee members reiterated once again their preference for communicating conditionalities on the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to increase transparency and enhance in this they reasserted that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of fiscal nature and adjustments in the brazilian economy are crucial for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of the with widespread benefits for the copom stressed the importance of other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective inflation and the associated balance of risks and is consistent with convergence of inflation to target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes the committee reiterates that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural copom emphasizes that the evolution of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential to maintain low inflation in the medium and long for the reduction of its structural interest and for sustainable recovery of the the copom judges that it should base its decisions on the evolution of inflation projections and of the balance of and of economic shocks that produce relative price changes should only lead to a monetary policy response to their possible effects to the propagation to prices in the economy that are not directly affected by the it is through such effects that these shocks may affect inflation projections and and change the balance of these effects may be mitigated by the level of economic slack and by inflation expectations anchored around the there is no mechanical relationship between recent shocks and the conduct of monetary in the the evolution of the baseline scenario and of the balance of risks prescribes keeping the selic rate at its current the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn carlos viana de carolina de assis costa de ribeiro paulo neves de reinaldo le sidnei and tiago couto monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price

products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through october in october the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in october partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly

retreats of and on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary the federal reserve has confirmed the end of the purchase program in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging the bank of japan expanded its program of monetary stimulus and signaled the possibility of new the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced in the emerging they stand at relatively high the price of the brent oil barrel decreased to a level near since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have fallen and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through october of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in unchanged relative to the october copom among other this projection considers gasoline and bottled gas price changes until october and as well as assumptions of a reduction in fixed telephone tariffs and the increase of in electricity the items for which there are more information were projected and for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change are for the same value considered at the october copom and for up from considered at the previous the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus both for and according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law and in the budget guidelines law project in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca fell from to for it increased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also fell relative to the value considered at the october meeting and remains above the inflation for according to both the baseline and the market the inflation forecast remained relatively stable above the inflation for the first three quarters of although the forecasts indicate that inflation enters a convergence path towards the target established by the the forecasts also point to inflation above this both in the baseline and in the market policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the despite recently released data have been less positive than the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have there are improvements in advanced with recovery of activity in some countries and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming on the other in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee highlights the evidences of tension and volatility focuses in the as well as the prospects of moderation in the dynamics of prices in the international the copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and gdp have converged and that the domestic activity expansion pace will be less intense this compared to according to the the activity tends to enter in a recovery trend in the second semester of next the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a more moderate and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a composition for growth more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates in the longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and their resulting gains depend on the strengthening of and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal despite of identifying evidence of fiscal stimuli in the composition of aggregate demand this according to the the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral zone during the relevant horizon for the monetary it argues that cannot rule out migration to the fiscal restraint the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections will contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also bears emphasizing that the generation of primary surpluses to strengthen the perception of the public sector balance sheet sustainability will contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which will stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit important to highlight the fact after years of strong expansion cooled with the introduction of macroprudential measures at the end of the credit market oriented to consumption has so over the last quarters it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit it attributes high probability that actions in this regard be implemented in the relevant horizon for the monetary regarding the the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum this is not as significant as in the previous and the occurrence of real wage changes is more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustments processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the copom also considers since its last among other the intensification of the aforementioned adjustments in relative prices in the economy has made the balance of risks to inflation less in this the committee does not rule out the occurrence of scenario which includes increase in inflation in the short and anticipates that inflation tends to remain high in but will enter in a long period of decline already in the next while recognizing that these adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts on the committee reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from given the above the committee unanimously decided to at this the adjustment of the selic rate and raise it by pp to without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei correa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively robust in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to record a moderate expansion due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial the concession of public the broadening of oil exploration among other tend to benefit the expansion of on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the targets according to the view of the tends to occur in the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary considering the cumulative and lagged effects of the monetary among other the committee evaluates that the additional effort of monetary policy tends to be implemented with at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on january for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june update of economic outlook and baseline recent data on economic activity indicate a halt in the process of economic recovery in the past baseline scenario assumes resumption of this process in a gradual the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic as reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook has become less owing to changes in the prospects for monetary policy in major the risks associated with a slowdown in global growth various measures of underlying inflation are running at appropriate this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the inflation projections in the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey stand around for and for this scenario among other a path for the selic rate that ends at and increases to over the course of it also assumes a path for the exchange rate that ends and at in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for in the scenario with a constant selic rate at and a constant exchange rate at inflation projections stand around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for risks around the baseline inflation unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the may copom meeting the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one the high level of economic slack may continue to produce prospective inflation on the other a possible frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary risk intensifies in case the global outlook for emerging economies the committee judges that the balance of risks has evolved but risk prevails at this discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available the members concluded that the process of economic recovery came to a halt in the past this halt is clear when adopting a slightly longer which suggests that there has been a change in the dynamics of the economy after the second quarter of from this the recovery of economic which occurred at a gradual pace until has lost after a slight decline in the first quarter of as a result of this loss of dynamism and some occasional gross domestic product is expected to remain relatively stable in the second the copom members assessed to a large the effects on economic activity of the main shocks suffered by the brazilian economy throughout have in financial conditions which had tightened significantly between the second and fourth quarters of have already moved into more stimulative in this the baseline scenario assumes resumption of the process of economic recovery in a gradual the copom members also discussed factors that could hinder economic in the context of the deep adjustments that the brazilian economy notably those of fiscal they stressed that value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed during the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom central do copom of uncertainties regarding fiscal sustainability tend to be in these uncertainties affect investment decisions that involve a high degree of irreversibility need greater predictability of future in a context of limited fiscal space for public they emphasized the importance of reforms that lead to future by reducing fundamental uncertainties about the brazilian these reforms tend to stimulate private this potential expansionary effect to some offset the impact of fiscal adjustments on economic as well as mitigate the risk of episodes of large risk premium as witnessed in the copom stressed the understanding that an acceleration of the pace of recovery of the economy to more robust levels will also depend on other initiatives aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and improvements in the business these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and development of the brazilian regarding the global the committee members deemed it less major central banks clearly indicated a willingness to provide additional monetary stimuli in case of which contributed to easing global financial the copom judges that the risks associated with a slowing global economy remain and that economic policy and geopolitical may contribute to an even lower global in light of evidence of economic slowdown in several some copom members considered that the global environment may be more relevant to the dynamics of economic activity than previously in this the copom members once again highlighted the capability of the brazilian economy to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of anchored inflation and prospects of future structural reforms and resumption of economic recovery the committee members discussed recent inflation projections and the levels of various measures of underlying the latter measures are deemed to be at appropriate with regard to the they pointed out that the fall of food inflation and recent favorable movements in fuel and electricity prices tend to produce lower inflation than previously these revisions explain a substantial share of the decline in the conditional projections for ipca at the horizon relevant to monetary which mainly includes the calendar year the scenarios with constant interest rates produce inflation slightly below target for while the scenarios with interest rate path extracted from the focus which provision of additional monetary produce inflation around the the committee members then discussed the since their previous of the factors highlighted in their balance of risks around the baseline inflation all members agreed that the balance of risks has evolved the copom members stressed that the consolidation of the benign scenario reflected in inflation expectations and in the aforementioned conditional projections depends on the pace of necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian which are essential for the sustainability of the environment with anchored inflations a possible frustration of expectations regarding the continuity of these reforms and adjustments may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary the committee judges at this this factor prevails in its balance of the copom members assessed that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at appropriate inflation projected around or slightly below and high level of slack in the economy prescribe stimulative monetary interest rates below the structural interest rate the structural interest rate is a reference for the conduct of monetary when this policy yields a real interest rate below the structural it provides stimulus for economic activity and contributes to an increase in as the structural rate is not observable and economic activity and inflation depend on several other estimates of this rate involve a high degree of uncertainty and are continually reassessed by the the committee members expressed the view that the current real interest rates provide stimulus to the this assessment is not inconsistent with recent expected economic since economic activity is influenced by several other as highlighted the committee also discussed the conditionalities that would prescribe stimulative monetary all members agreed that the appropriate level of stimulus depends on the particularly on inflation the level of slack in the the balance of and inflation the provision of monetary stimulus requires an environment with anchored inflation the committee members then discussed the monetary policy in light of the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its may meeting they unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at central do copom the committee deems important to observe how the brazilian economy will behave over with reduction of the degree of uncertainty to which it remains the committee members reiterated their preference for communicating the conditionalities for the conduct of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality guiding their this contributes to increase transparency and enhance the copom reiterates its view that the continuity of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for the reduction of its structural interest for the full operation of monetary and for a sustainable economic the committee also stresses that the perception of continuation of the reform agenda affects current expectations and macroeconomic in the committee judges that concrete progress in this agenda is fundamental for the consolidation of the benign scenario for prospective the copom emphasizes that the next steps in the conduct of monetary policy will continue to depend on the evolution of economic

depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and on inflation projections and the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carlos viana de carolina de assis manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro paulo neves de and tiago couto update of economic outlook and the global environment remains adverse and with marked downward revisions on prospective global growth in an environment of inflationary the growth of major economies has been revised down for and due to the expected reversal of the stimuli implemented during the long pandemic in those of monetary the war in ukraine impacts the supply of natural thus bringing additional uncertainty to the european economic in the deterioration of the real estate coupled with the policy to fight negatively impact the growth inflation rates figures in some advanced economies released in the period suggest the persistence of strong although an incipient normalization in the supply chains and accommodation in the prices of leading commodities is already observed coupled with the adjustment of inventories of industrial these developments might imply the moderation of inflationary pressures related to on the other the degree of slack in the labor market in these economies suggests that inflationary pressures in the sector of services might take long to central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a more contractionary stance against increased the acceleration in the process of normalization of monetary policy in advanced the increase in risk and the change in the growth outlook have impacted financial conditions in both advanced and emerging affecting the volatility of assets and economic growth the committee continues monitoring the risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary turning to the brazilian the set of indicators released since the previous copom meeting continues to suggest that the economy grew throughout the second with the labor market recovery stronger than expected by the indicators related to both formal job openings and employment and unemployment rates suggest a rapid normalization in the sectors after the consumer inflation remains with increases spread among several and continues to be more persistent than the reduction of taxes on energy prices is already observed in high frequency although the components more sensitive to the economic cycle and monetary with higher inflationary continue above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and scenarios and risk in the reference the interest rate path is extracted from the focus and the exchange rate starts at and evolves according to the purchasing power parity this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at falls to in and to in the committee assumes that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six months and then start increasing per year the energy flag is assumed to be in december and in this inflation projections stand at for for and for inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the projections based on the reference scenario incorporate the tax measures recently for the which mitigates the impact but incorporates the effects of the tax measures that occur in and the first quarter of the inflation projection stands at the committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than the committee evaluates that the global inflationary scenario is still pressures stemming from both persistently high demand for as well as supply shocks linked to the war in and policies restricting trade in agricultural products in might have consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary the of future global demand has led to price declines of leading commodities as well as the prospects of reduced imbalance in the industrial goods even reiterates that some geopolitical and particular issues in these markets still deserve the committee discussed the impacts of the global synchrony in the process of stimulus copom noticed a more accelerated pace in the process of monetary policy adjustment in advanced as well as the commitment stated in the communication of major central banks to reduce inflationary it was observed that this movement elevated the market unevenly impacting several assets and increasing risk in given the persistence of the inflationary process in advanced economies and the consequent responses by several central the committee evaluates that the probability of alternative scenarios incorporating a sharper deceleration of global economic activity the uncertainty about the energy scenario in the dynamics of sectors more sensitive to interest rates in the united and the prospects of a more gradual growth in china contribute to this in the domestic copom evaluates that temporary policies aimed to support income could provide stimulus to aggregate demand and the extension of these policies might increase the risk premia and inflation expectations as they pressure aggregate demand and worsen the fiscal the committee reiterates that there are several channels by which fiscal policy may affect including its effect on asset and inflation labor market especially concerning the pace of job openings and the unemployment surprised in the period and indicate a narrowing of the estimate of the output the committee evaluates that economic slackness it is noteworthy that evaluations about the output especially about the component related to the labor are always subject to notably in the current situation in which the economy is still normalizing after the pandemic and with remarkable heterogeneity across sectors in this copom will continue monitoring and evaluating the output gap in the next the committee still considers that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly it emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary and an increase in the risk premium due to the uncertainty about the future fiscal framework and additional fiscal stimuli that support aggregate partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset among the downside it should be noted a possible even if of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local and a greater deceleration of economic activity than the committee assesses that the possibility that fiscal policies that support aggregate demand become permanent heightens the upside risks of the inflationary on the other the committee notes that the rising risk of a greater global deceleration increases the downside risks to the committee assesses that the still uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the prospective discussion about the conduct of monetary copom discussed the conduct of monetary considering the set of projections as well as the balance of risks for following its usual the relevant horizon for monetary policy now refers to the year to a lesser at this the committee noted that inflation projections for the years of and were heavily impacted by temporary tax measures across calendar the committee decided to emphasize the projections for inflation in the first quarter of which reflects the relevant smoothens out the primary effects from tax but incorporates their effects on the relevant inflation projections for monetary policy the inflation projection for the first quarter of which incorporates the secondary effects of the tax changes as well as the cumulative effects of keeping interest rates at a significantly contractionary level is consistent with the strategy of inflation convergence to around the target over the relevant the committee noted that inflation projection for is also around the copom opened the discussion by evaluating the adjustment cycle carried out up to this it was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and due to the long and variable monetary policy much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be these impacts should become clearer in the activity indicators for the second half of the but the committee anticipates that measures to sustain aggregate which will be implemented in the short may make it difficult a more precise evaluation about the stage of the economic cycle and the impacts of monetary the committee noted that the inflationary dynamics remains with increasing core inflation measures in an environment of surprises in current and that its projections continued to even though the scenario is surrounded by uncertainty and volatility above the it was emphasized that the rise in expectations and projections was concentrated in the inflation of administered due to the temporary nature of some tax the committee based on the projections used and on its balance of that the strategy required to bring the projected inflation to around the target for the relevant horizon required that the monetary tightening cycle continued to move significantly further into contractionary with an additional adjustment at this meeting and the maintenance of the interest rate in significantly contractionary territory for a sufficiently extended copom then debated the monetary policy options for this the committee concluded that a further adjustment of was appropriate in an environment of high despite the already significantly contractionary stage of monetary considering its should affect the economy more strongly as of the second half of the committee decided to signal that it will assess the need for a smaller residual adjustment at the next with the aim of bringing inflation to around the target in the relevant given the persistence of recent the committee will remain vigilant and will assess whether the prospect of maintaining the selic rate by itself for a sufficiently long period will ensure such a this strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant as well as the anchoring of inflation while reflecting the already implemented monetary reinforcing the cautious monetary policy and emphasizing the uncertainty of the monetary policy taking into account the assessed the balance of and the broad array of available copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective an even variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary which includes to a lesser without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive the committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets the committee will evaluate the need for a residual of lower in its next the copom emphasizes that it will remain vigilant and that future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its it also stresses that the uncertainty of the current both domestic and foreign coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy and its cumulative impacts yet to be require additional caution in its the following members of the committee voted for this roberto de oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis diogo abry fernanda rumenos costa de ribeiro paulo neves de and renato dias de brito unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes that occurred since the june copom meeting value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the last day of the week before the copom ipca after recording and in june and remained close to zero in august and increased in september to as a inflation accumulated in the first nine months of reached above the one observed in the same period of inflation increase in the behavior of market which increased by in the year through september and contributed with of the recorded in the on its regulated which increased in the year through decelerated and totaled in the year through compared to in the same period of contributing only to cumulative inflation in the year through regarding market it bears emphasizing that while the prices of tradable goods reached in the year through september in twelve the prices of goods reached in twelve the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of shows some and reached in the year through september and in twelve the increase in the monthly ipca index in september is greatly due to the elevation in the prices of food and in information available evidences deterioration of the inflationary dynamics at the restricted to some a movement that was anticipated by the the volatility of food prices performed a fundamental role in the behavior of headline in due to accentuated swings in these the ipca dynamics showed two distinct pronounced rise in the first when food and beverages prices changed and relative stability in the following when they retreated it also bears emphasizing that trailing household food price inflation increased from in december to in april and returned to in at the same trailing ipca inflation reached and this behavior of food price inflation partially mirrored domestic and external supply whose impacts were possibly heightened by the high volatility environment in international financial for the last the most likely scenario indicates the continuity of this with elevation of the headline inflation mainly determined by the increase in food in line with the evolution of headline the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased between august and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in august to in in the same the double weight core inflation measure increased from to and the core inflation by exclusion rose from to in the year through the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased up from recorded in the same period of according to the same comparison double weight core inflation measure increased to up from while the core inflation by exclusion reached up from trailing inflation on its in and for the core inflation by smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation above the midpoint of the inflation the ipca diffusion which had retreated to in reached in august and in the general price index inflation recorded in the same change observed in but above the rate registered in july in the year through the inflation reached above the level recorded in the same period of according to the same comparison inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index rose reflecting the increases of and in industrial and agricultural the inflation change above the change recorded in the same period of inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the increased in the year through above the recorded in the same period of under the same inflation measured by the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased also above the rate recorded in the same period of as emphasized in previous copom meeting the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the ibge and geography brazilian released information about the data showed expansion in which increased in the second and a increase gdp growth to great statistical carry in was observed in the demand components and supply on the aggregate demand household consumption and public administration consumption and gross fixed capital formation increased imports grew and exports increased according to the same comparison still on a the contribution of domestic demand to the gdp growth was positive the most remarkable one since offsetting the negative contribution stemming from the external on the aggregate supply still according to the same comparison the services sector grew by while industry grew by and the index of economic activity of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for products taxes it constitutes an important coincident indicator of economic after registering positive growth rates in all months of until april the ibcbr has shown stability in the last in the remained and changed in july after recording stability in the previous a less intense pace of economic activity than previously in contrast to the fast pace observed in the first quarter of after strong retreat due to the industrial output but it has shown some accommodation at levels similar to those observed in the according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output recorded in after increasing in the threemonth moving average growth rate reached considering the period ended in equal to the rate recorded in the period ended in and above the one registered between march and june the production increased in august similar to the rate recorded in july according to the same comparison on a trailing industrial production expanded by in above the july rate compared to december a record low for industrial production level registered during the crisis recovery up to august totaled industrial activity has partially been supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the most important driver in was capital goods which increased by consumer goods and intermediate goods production were recording and on a moving average the production for the three categories for capital for intermediate goods and for consumer it bears highlighting that capital goods production expanded by in the year through the most remarkable expansion among the use evidencing the growth in capital goods investment as a relevant factor in the economic recovery of the the future behavior of industrial production will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen which should continue to be additional source of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey decreased from in july to in lower than the observed in august according to observed after reaching in march the rate not only retreated significantly until but it reached a historical record low considering the last nine years of the which methodology was extensively revised in also according to the seasonally adjusted the rate retreated in reaching a record low for the series measured by the number of employed workers in the metropolitan increased by in august and also in july compared to in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that formal employment continues to present strong although september data do not suggest in thousand jobs were compared to thousand jobs registered in september in the first nine months of million jobs were a expansion relative to the same period of and the best result for the period since when the series among the manufacturing industry contributing with of job creation in the in the services contributed the most of total job real average earnings also increased in august relative to in as a real payroll expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased in in july and in as a the average of sales increased in the quarter ended in compared to the quarter ended in also seasonally the moving average of expanded retail sales increased in on a expanded retail sales increased in in july and in all ten sectors surveyed increased in the two key drivers were magazines and with growth and and which increased in the next months it is expected that the retail sales trajectory continues to be benefited by governmental by real payroll by credit expansion and by consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in up from in standing close to the levels registered prior to the according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reached in september in the previous among the four use the nuci in construction inputs industry was the only one to reduce reaching the highest among the use on the other the nuci for capital goods increased the nuci for the intermediate goods industry increased while the nuci for consumer goods industry increased totaling and according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci decreased to in after reaching in july and in evidence suggests that the utilization rates have accommodated at high and that the maintenance of the reduced idleness margin is the result of the recent economic activity still not totally offset by the maturity of completed and ongoing investment it bears noticing that the absorption of capital goods increased in august and the production of construction inputs also increased in august and on a twelve month trailing expansion totaled as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade after reaching a billion surplus in totaled billion in billion lower than the obtained in the same period last this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade the behavior of remittances of profits and which also reflects the growth differential between the brazilian economy and the economy in other has contributed to elevate the trailing current account which reached billion in equivalent to of up from billion in on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of resulting in an additional need of foreign funding equivalent to of the global economy recovery continues to be led by a group of emerging whose steady pace of economic expansion is anchored mainly by domestic regarding the economies euro zone and there are evidences that the recovery process may be slower than anticipated in the first half of the the possibility of eventual reversion in this recovery process cannot be completely the us economic activity data indicate a scenario of gradual recovery from the but at a more moderate pace of growth than that recorded in the first consumer confidence in the us reached a new record low and the signs of relevant idleness margin not only in the american but also in the euro area and in in the the unemployment rate remained at of the labor force in in the euro the unemployment rate remained at in with increasing dispersion among the while in germany the rate reduced to a record low since in spain it increased to regarding inflation they have remained at very low levels in the despite the extremely expansionist economic policy both at the fiscal and at the monetary in its short term interest rate was reduced to an interval between zero and returning to the zero interest rate monetary ended in july the monetary authority in japan also announced a new policy of assets the possibility that also the us adopts new expansionist monetary policy actions has contributed for the acceleration of the devaluation process of the us dollar that had been observed in the last among emerging it bears highlighting that the chinese central bank increased its interest rate after a long period of since the last copom monetary tightening has also been observed in although in a magnitude lower than previously in india and in whereas monetary policy easing has been observed in south for the first time in five oil in spot and futures increased to levels above the low predictability of the asymmetric rebound of global the dependence of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and the geopolitical complexity of the sector add uncertainty to oil prices the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline oil prices swings might affect the domestic for through the petrochemical sector or through expectations regarding agricultural their prices continued to record with highlights for cotton and industrial commodities prices have also these price increases may be explained by price movements of important currencies and commodities global demand although the recent performance of which represent little more than of global continues the demand for commodities by emerging economies has increased in a robust for the prices on its the volatility observed in commodities prices results from a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and fx markets volatility is of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustment for fixed telephone for reduced to down from which was considered in the september while the projected adjustment for electricity prices for reduced to down from the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was kept unchanged relative to the september meeting at according to the benchmark this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total september the projection for regulated prices inflation for was reduced to down from considered in the september according to the benchmark such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be reduced by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refers to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to of gdp in and the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations increased from to the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the september copom and is considerably above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin at the period immediately prior the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also and it stands considerably above the inflation midpoint for under both the benchmark and the market the projection increased relative to the figure considered at the september copom but it remains around the inflation midpoint regarding the third quarter of in both the projection is around the inflation midpoint policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the price the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary and help the process of coordination of economic mainly price it is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation targets stands at advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last six at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the fx and inflationary risk premium among other seem to have resulted in significant reduction of the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has increased in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of it should be emphasized that this perception is supported by estimates generated by macroeconometric models used by the in it is also noteworthy according to half of the analysts who responded to the consultation carried out by the the neutral rate in brazil would currently be at levels equal to or lower than the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy in international risk aversion and volatility have remained high since the last copom with higher prospects for the increase of global concerns about european countries sovereign debt and the deceleration in china remain as well as about the sustainability of the us economy even the prices of some commodities and brazilian assets increased prospects for external funding for the brazilian economy remain the trajectory of price indices evidences the cooling of inflationary pressures in some relevant whereas concerns regarding the prospects of deflation in other economies in this the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation remains although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook the copom reaffirms its view that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are although the accommodation observed in the last two quarters has been more intense than expected at the start of the as among by data on inventories and industrial the prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain this assessment is among other by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to despite at a more moderate both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor despite the cooling in the generation of jobs in specific the copom once that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current and past inflation the prospective scenario substantially deteriorated early this but this dynamic has greatly mirroring less favorable prospects for global activity and the monetary policy actions implemented this since the last the scenario was negatively influenced by the dynamics of food which partially reflects supply despite the difficulty in identifying the nature of these and their duration and the possibility of monetary policy should act to prevent its the the high contribution of food prices to headline when compared to historical suggests the ongoing materialization of risks that had been identified and taken into account in the balance of risks assessed at the last copom the prevailing view is that the convergence of inflation to the midpoint target tends to for the copom finds support in the pertinent considerations that monetary policy acts with time lags over activity and and that the effects of the adjustment process in the base interest rate initiated in april completely materialized it is worth noticing that this hypothesis of convergence is subject to the materialization of the trajectories regarding fiscal and credit variables which the committee the committee ensures in case this scenario does not promptly the monetary policy stance should be adjusted in order to guarantee the convergence between the pace of demand and supply from another in case inflation does not promptly converge to the midpoint target established by the monetary policy will act in order to redirect price dynamics ensure the target to be the intensity and frequency of shocks that both the global and brazilian economies have undergone in recent years impose additional challenges to the analysis of the prospective evidence in this respect are for in the bimodal character of view polled by the as some participants perceive a benign inflation in which the selic rate would remain stable in the relevant while other participants show skepticism and advocate the base on its the committee recognizes an economic environment in which the uncertainty level prevails above the where the remaining risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario stem from the domestic for it bears highlighting those deriving from domestic demand in a context of narrow idleness margin in the use of production regarding this it is important to highlight that some stability has been recently observed in the capacity utilization rate at high as well as some moderation in the dynamism of the labor market for public in this it seems plausible to affirm that the factors that support these domestic risks have there are signs that the economy has moved towards a trajectory closer to equilibrium the effects of demand pressures and of the high level of utilization of factors over the balance of risks for inflation tend to cool in since the last the risks considered by the copom at that time have the current balance of risks still points to the accomplishment of a benign in which inflation would consistent with the inflation targets which is largely due to the adjustment of the base rate implemented since also contributing to this scenario is the new information released since indicating an improvement in the balance of risks related to the regulated prices as well as that the slowdown of economic activity in the last two quarters was more intense than the projected at the start of the regarding the external the probability of and even of the already slow process of recovery of economies remains as a the influence of the international scenario over domestic inflation behavior shows some disinflationary under these evaluating the macroeconomic outlook and the inflation the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although they tend to cool fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and should still contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness margin of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial by those referring to the worsening of the global economy prospects and especially by those stemming from the change in the monetary policy these elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on december for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in up from in august and in the index increased by in the year and in twelve compared to recorded in the year through the ipca acceleration in september reflected especially the greater variation in market which reached in the up from in the change in regulated prices also contributed to a higher ipca rate in the reaching compared to in the behavior of market prices reflected mainly the acceleration of the prices of tradable whose rate increased from in august to in the prices of goods increased from to despite the stability in the change of services in august and considering the behavior of the ipca by it is worth noticing the increase of in the prices of food and group that had been the main driver of the relative price stability in the two preceding contributing to the ipca change in the diffusion index reached up from in august and in the changes in the three ipca core inflation measures have accelerated in september the smoothed core inflation increased up from in the previous totaling in twelve compared to in core inflation by which excludes ten items of household food and the items related to vehicle rose in up from in accumulating in twelve up from in the previous the double weight core inflation increased in up from in accumulating in twelve unchanged relative to the previous the increased in unchanged relative to totaling an increase in the year and in twelve the wholesale price index increased by in down from in influenced exclusively by the acceleration of agricultural from to considering the slowdown in the change of industrial from to in the last twelve months through the ipa increased due to increases of and in the prices of agricultural and industrial the main drivers of wholesale prices were contributing and poultry the increased by in up from in totaling in twelve the incc rose in up from in reaching in the last twelve economic activity the showed stability in after increasing by in considering seasonally adjusted for the quarter ended in the also showed stability compared to the quarter ended in the indicator increased in the year through august and in twelve expanded retail sales recorded growth at the margin for the fourth consecutive increasing by in after increasing in july and in according to data seasonally adjusted by the monthly survey according to seasonally adjusted sales increased in all ten segments with highlights for the increases recorded by magazines and stationery furniture and appliances pharmaceutical and medical articles and parts and pieces for the quarter ended in retail sales grew expanded retail sales grew in accumulating increases of in the year and in the last twelve all segments increased with highlights for office material and equipment construction inputs and parts and pieces in the sales also increased for all especially those regarding office material and equipment furniture and appliances and construction inputs expanded retail sales in the last twelve months through compared to the same previous also shows generalized increase by with highlights to the rise in office material and equipment and parts and pieces and furniture and appliances automobile sales by including light commercial trucks and reduced in according to fenabrave federation of automotive vehicles seasonally adjusted by the it bears highlighting the fall in the sales of total sales decreased a result influenced by the decrease in automobile the other categories buses and light commercial vehicles showed significant increases of and in the year and in the last twelve months through automobile sales increased respectively and reflecting stronger sales in all capital goods imports increased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the indicator rose while in the year and on a trailing it increased and compared to the same periods of the previous capital goods production increased in month on resulting in a decrease of in the quarter ended in according to data from the monthly industrial survey by major advances in production in were recorded in the segments of capital goods for construction capital goods for the power sector and capital goods for industrial purposes among the sectors that recorded declines in it bears highlighting capital goods for agriculture for the capital goods production increased with an emphasis on the production for which increased by industrial production decreased in after changing in according to seasonally adjusted data from the by use capital goods production while other categories with emphasis on the decrease of in intermediate considering industry the major changes were observed in machines and equipment medical equipment other transport equipment and printing and reproduction the main negative drivers were electronic material and communication equipment basic metallurgy tobacco and pharmaceutical products industrial production increased with special emphasis on the production of capital goods intermediate goods durable consumer goods and and consumer goods on a trailing general industry grew in with highlights to the increases in the production of durable consumer goods capital goods and intermediate goods the nuci in the manufacturing calculated by reached in corresponding to seasonally a increase relative to the previous seasonally and a increase the increase in the installed capacity utilization rate was observed in all use categories for both comparison except for construction durable consumer goods and intermediate goods and capital goods and and construction material and vehicles production reached thousand units in according to data released by the anfavea and seasonally adjusted by representing a downfall of relative to the sector production expanded by by in the year and by in the last twelve months through vehicles sales decreased in exclusively influenced by a fall in domestic market while exports expanded by in the year and in the last twelve domestic sales increased by and while exports expanded by and the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in september projected an annual expansion for grains in representing million above the record compared to the growth projection for the year reflected especially the upward movements of corn soybeans and wheat and expectations according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the fgv the consumer confidence index increased in seasonally reaching the result was influenced by the increase in the current situation index which reached a historical record high for the sixth consecutive while the expectation index decreased by the icc increased reflecting increases of in isa and of in the industry confidence index from fgv increased in reaching considering seasonally adjusted as a result of the increase in the whereas the isa decreased the ici grew reflecting increases of in the isa and of in the in the last two there was decrease in optimism about the industry at present and recovery in relation to the future the services confidence index from fgv reduced in september after increasing by in the previous influenced by the falls of in the current situation index and in the expectation index the september ics stood at above the average and above the september the

the consumer expectation index in the year through the icc increased market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in increasing considered seasonally adjusted in the year through thousand jobs were a record high for the which started in january according to the same comparison hiring registered a record in expansion in the services sector in manufacturing industry in civil construction and in commerce the net creation of formal employment exceeds by the figure recorded in the same period of while formal employment increased by in the same according the same comparison regarding the activity sectors mentioned formal employment increased and in it bears highlighting the hiring in the service sector in the manufacturing industry and in commerce in the last twelve months through thousand formal jobs were created in the according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate declined for the third consecutive reaching in a historical record declining and in seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate also reached in declining as a result of falls from in the economically active population and in according to the same average real earnings usually earned by workers increased and in the year through contributing for payroll and according the same comparison and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in equivalent to of increasing by in the in the year and in twelve credit

mirrored the rises in the average tenure of credit for individuals and corporate days and which totaled days and following the same delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety reduced in reaching after reaching the record high in august the delinquency rate has been showing a consistent declining delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate remained stable at while those regarding credit to individuals declined reaching in environment according to international monetary fund projections released at the start of global economy should grow by in and in revising the july which signaled and according to the observed since the beginning of the financial the global economic dynamics has remained driven mainly by the emerging which are expected to grow by this while among developed growth is expected to reach in the despite the consumption that the labor market still remains gdp growth should reach compared to the previous forecast of the projection has also been retreating to down from in the commodities agricultural prices increasing in dollar terms since the last copom mainly as a result of the dollar the strengthening of chinese demand and adverse weather the metallic and energy commodities rose and in the despite this as the mature economies continue to present significant output price indices are in the driven by the declining path of inflationary the federal reserve concerns imposing to the monetary authority to manifest regarding that the current prices level is incompatible with its maximum employment and price stability in this the central banks of economies maintained the accommodative stance of their with the bank of japan announcing a new stage of quantitative easing and the reintroduction of the zero interest rate policy in the emerging despite some basic interest rate as occurred in chile and the monetary policy stance continues to support economic as central banks have maintained the basic interest rates below the levels observed prior to the beginning of the with the perception that it will be necessary to continue to delay the withdrawal of monetary stimuli introduced during that the evaluation is partially due to the perception of the likely deepening of the accommodative stance adopted by the which has implied in persistent dollar to the demand increase of government securities relative to mature whose yields remain in a low and to the frequent interventions in the fx especially in emerging economies south africa and among it is important to highlight that since the last copom the financial markets have been characterized by deep dollar lower risk the stock market valuation and volatility according to the vix the vix index retreated to standing close to the values recorded at the end of before the fiscal crisis deepening in european trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in accumulating billion in the first nine months of the in the exports totaled and on a daily average the trade surplus fell by mirroring a growth in imports and a growth in total external trade accumulated billion in the growing by relative to the first nine months of international reserves reached billion in recording a billion growth and a billion growth in the the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic in the accumulating billion in the first nine months of market and open market operations since the september copom the futures interest rate yield curve shifted upwards for tenors one mainly driven by the release of inflation by the increase of focus survey inflationary expectations and by the release of robust data for employment and between august and september and rates increased by and from september these rates started a declining mirrored by the release of domestic activity by the signals of low recovery of us economy and by the expectation of new monetary easing measures in developed on october the domestic interest rate yield curve stood almost at the same level recorded at the end of between august and october and rates decreased by and the and rates decreased by and while the rate increased by real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation fell from on august to on october in its open market the bcb carried between august and october repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between and working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of tenure liquidity management the very including the tenure liquidity management averaged a daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreement of the central bank increased from billion between july and august to between august and october considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was a rise in the repurchase agreements totaling elevating the total stock from billion on august to billion on october the main drivers of liquidity expansion in the period were the bcb interventions in the fx the net expenses of the union and the net redemption of federal public between august and october the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of inflationlinked reached for securities maturing in and ipca inflation increased in down from in may and totaling in the first seven months of compared to in the same period of last although inflation has situated below that of july acceleration at the margin has been observed for the fourth consecutive this behavior was partially expected due to the exceptionally low inflation recorded in the second quarter of average of only as a result of the downturn in food prices at the it bears emphasizing that recent inflation acceleration essentially reflects the behavior of market which have increased more rapidly than regulated prices in a reversal in the dynamics observed in the recent in market prices and regulated prices recorded and in the year through and and in the last twelve despite the brl appreciation in there are price among market stemming from tradable in the twelve months through tradable goods inflation totaled up from observed in the same period of last whereas inflation acceleration for goods was more totaling up from in the same period of preliminary inflation indicators for such as the show the continuity of inflation and suggest that such process might become more notwithstanding the recent occurrence of inflation developments less benign than previously price dynamics still indicates that inflation should continue to evolve according to the targets in line with headline the three ipca core inflation measures calculated by the bcb declined in with highlights for the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated which totaled in down from in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures reached and in the year through core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices reached below the rate observed last year and headline inflation in the same smoothed and trimmed means core inflation also stood below headline totaling and down from and recorded in on a twelvemonth trailing the three core inflation as well as headline stood below the target for the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices and smoothed and nonsmoothed trimmed means core inflation reached and down from and recorded in the same month of similarly to the headline core inflation measures for august suggest acceleration and higher diffusion of the general price index inflation stood at in up from in in the year through inflation increased up from in the same period of last on a twelvemonth trailing acceleration was totaling up from in the same period last this move was driven by the similar behavior of the consumer price which increased up from and the which totaled up from in the same despite at high inflation as measured by the civil construction national index showed stability this compared to last regarding wholesale agricultural prices resulting in a change in agricultural ipa in the last twelve months through in contrast to a deflation in the same period of last on the other industrial prices behaved positively in the recording down from in august of last regarding wholesale industrial there are signs of acceleration at the as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output grew in continuing to show a robust expansion even if relatively less intense than in still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output declined in industrial output grew in july relative to the same month last in the year through industrial output grew by and on a trailing the decline observed in july was exclusively due to the performance of manufacturing which retracted since mining expanded by in the last twelve months through manufacturing industry grew while mining expanded by for the few leading and coincident indicators available for industrial production are not inconsistent with the continuity of the industrial expansion which will be favored by the several stimulus factors that influence economic including the monetary easing already among the use only durable consumer goods production increased in july on a according to data seasonally adjusted by the while the sharper decline occurred in the production of and consumer goods production on the other in the year through capital goods production strongly grew by and durable consumer goods expanded by the dynamics of durable consumer goods production to a large the remarkable improvement in credit when compared to historical the accelerated expansion of capital goods production is due to the of positive prospects for the continuity of domestic demand which has reflected not only the improvement of income and the expansion of but also the perception of higher macroeconomic labor market continues to present fairly positive the unemployment rate in the six main metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey decreased again in july and stood at compared to the same month of last it declined in the sixth consecutive fall according to this comparison so that the average unemployment rate reduced by in the year through compared to the same period last the purchasing power of employed workers decreased in it increased relative to the same month last and in the year through as a real payrolls expanded by in the year through compared to the same period of last becoming a key driver for sustained aggregate demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in july and compared to july regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirm the continuity of strong job creation grew seasonally adjusted expanding by both in the year through july and in the last twelve with highlights to employment expansions in the civil construction industry and in the retail sector these figures corroborate the creation of million formal jobs in the year through july and million formal jobs in the last twelve in line with the positive developments in labor and with the expansion of retail sales continue to record positive retail sales increased in the sixth consecutive according to data seasonally adjusted by the compared to the same month of retail sales increased by in the first half of relative to the same period of last retail sales grew by and in the last twelve by amongst the it bears emphasizing the expansion of clothing and shoes and furniture and domestic appliances compared to the same month of last these developments confirm the view expressed in previous copom minutes that both the expansion of income and the improvement of consumer credit conditions are crucially important to the strengthening of aggregate demand in expanded retail which include the sales of civil construction material and parts and grew by in compared to the same month of in line with the performance observed in the recent for the next it is expected the strengthening of retail boosted by the increase in employment and credit expansion and by the recovery of consumer which so far has not been affected by the higher volatility in the financial the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the stood at in above the rate observed in which had declined relative to the installed capacity utilization rate in july almost resumed the rate observed in a record high for the according to cni installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry in july stood above the rate observed in the same month of the twelfth consecutive expansion under this in the year through the installed capacity utilization average rate stood above the observed in the same period of and above the rate observed in the same period of and such increase economic activity despite the strong expansion of in in the year through the absorption of capital goods grew in line with the significant increase in capital goods imports in as well as in capital goods production in the same the production of civil construction inputs increased the most recent data indicate that investment has contributed to a slowdown in the elevation of capacity utilization but has not been sufficient to avoid the persistence at relatively high which in the with periods of inflation in this the expansion of investment and the maturing of projects will be fundamental to avoid sharp mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand despite the at the the trade balance continues to present robust confirming the evaluations reported in inflation reports and previous copom minutes that depict important structural changes in the brazilian foreign in the year through the trade surplus reached a decrease relative to the same period of exports rose to while imports increased to as stressed in previous copom imports have been growing more than exports at the due not only to the strengthening of the but and to the higher level of economic on the other the effects of us real state sector crisis over global growth may slow down global demand for brazilian in any these two movements point out to an adjustment process in the trade due to important structural changes in the brazilian foreign trade over the recent international financial markets have experimented periods of financial turmoil since the last copom there is greater perception that investments in us real state have triggered losses not so far fully assessed in extension and distribution over financial institutions in developed this uncertain global financial scenario resulted in liquidity problems across credit and money central particularly those of europe and in the have promptly answered by increasing liquidity provisions and facilitating the access to the discount these economies continue to have problems of asymmetric access to interbank despite at a less intensive manner than observed in these developments had important impact over monetary policy prospects in developed towards at least in the short the scope for restrictive in the probability of additional monetary tightening in the us seems not only due to the problems of interbank but also even considering that part of the adjustments in the us activity level in response to the crisis may already have it is more likely that spillover effects on the financial sector and the consumer confidence cause a stronger economic even considering that europe and the major asian countries record robust despite the economic cooling in the us crisis may have negatively impact world the brazilian economy remains sound and shows greater resilience to face the international markets so the international crisis does not seem to have significantly impacted inflation and domestic economic unequivocal evidence of the benefits stemming from the highly improved external solvency over the recent it must be that the external scenario became more uncertain than evaluated in the previous copom and that the changes in the international market sentiment and the increase in the risk perception must be closely oil another source of international remains at elevated levels and still presents high on one this behavior reflects structural shifts in global demand for energy on the other recurrent episodes of geopolitical despite the uncertainties surrounding the expectations about the future trend for oil the main scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in remains the prices of other commodities also present high due to the heightened uncertainty about the prospects for global growth and the recent turmoil on global of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the july copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at the projections for electricity and fixed telephone price adjustments in were modified and the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at these according to the weights released by the represent of the total july the projection for regulated prices inflation in was also at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of reaching bps in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the july copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased to up from this growth was mainly driven by the addition of the inflation occurred in july and by the increase in the inflation expectations for the others months of the third quarter of ahead inflation expectations reached up from for inflation expectations remained at these developments continue to suggest the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased substantially compared to the value considered at the july copom but remained below the target established by the cmn for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the value considered at the july copom but remains below the central target for the the projection for based on the benchmark scenario increased while the projection based on the market scenario reduced in relation to but both remained below the monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion can increase the probability of important pressures over inflation in the in addition to investment imports growth has remarkably contributed to slow down this complementing domestic production limiting potential inflationary effects stemming from aggregate demand sustained despite uncertainties regarding the continuity of the strong growth in the international economy and the volatility increase in global markets since the last copom the prospects for brazilian external financing in the forecast period according to newly available that the balance of payments may not present a risk to the inflation even with the increase in inflation prospects remain in line with the targets as in recent the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the the copom evaluates that emerging local inflationary pressures are more likely to represent risks to domestic inflation because the heated demand can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the nontradable the copom also observes that the increase in ipca inflation expectations for and for twelve months despite to levels below the targets established for and is a process that must be carefully in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate demand and remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts as well as the effects of the economic activity on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic despite the current inflation acceleration and some increase in the market interest as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next quarters of the year and for the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have limited effects in and predominant impacts in the pace of domestic demand may continue to be sustained by factors such as the impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented this but it may still bring risks to the inflationary the last developments suggest that the contribution of the external sector to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario may become less aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom has privileged a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty related to the process of monetary policy that is the reason why variables such as inflation projections and the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so in this the committee considered the option of keeping the basic interest rate despite recognizing that several factors would already support the decision of keeping the selic rate unaltered this the committee evaluated the macroeconomic scenario and understood that the balance of risks to the evolution of future inflation would still justify an additional monetary the committee unanimously decided to reduce the selic target rate to without the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to define the next steps on its monetary policy under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine price dynamics and its balance of domestic demand continues to expand the economic activity this expansion encompasses some sectors little exposed to external at the time when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already are still not fully in spite of not being an imminent threat to inflation the contribution of the external sector to the maintenance of a benign inflationary scenario may become less in such the monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on october for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october summary of data analyzed by the copom inflation the went up in up from in july and in totaling in the year and in twelve the prices of food and beverages increased up from in for the mainly driven by the growth in the prices of milk and its the prices of perishable food retreated again in following the pattern that has been observed since the average increase in fixed telephone prices contributed for the gasoline and alcohol prices contracted in august and altogether influenced the with market prices inflation totaled in up from in while regulated prices decreased to down from in the same in twelve market prices accumulated and regulated among market the prices of goods increased while the prices of tradable goods totaled according to the same comparison the several core inflation measures showed that inflation increased in not only on a but also on a trailing the smoothed trimmed means core rose in up from in in twelve the variation totaled against in the nonsmoothed trimmed means core reached in up from in totaling in twelve the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in up from in totaling in twelve the increased in compared to in the highest rate recorded since june in the last twelve the totaled against observed in higher inflation in the prices of wholesale products was responsible for the acceleration of the primarily due to the increase in agricultural the increased up from in reaching in twelve months and in the year through the prices of agricultural products grew up from in while the prices of industrials increased up from in the previous economic activity according to monthly survey retail sales increased seasonally adjusted in all activities with seasonally adjusted data with highlights to furniture and home which increased sales of vehicles and parts and which are not part of the general retail sales grew in the regionally out of federation units achieved positive results in the retail sales increased in compared to the same month of last driven by increases in all its components mainly in and shoes furniture and home appliances expanded retail including civil construction inputs and parts and registered a with highlights to a expansion in motor retail sales performance reflects the continuity of payroll growth and better credit together with the impacts of social programs and the recovery of the agricultural retail sales increased in the first half of compared to the same period of while expanded retail sales increased by it bears emphasizing the increase in the sales of vehicles and furniture and domestic appliances in the same on a regional all states recorded growth in retail sales under this comparison and the most significant expansions occurred in the northeastern and northern especially due to the impact of federal government social assistance programs in these são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the showed decreases of in consultations to the usecheque system and in database consultations for credit sales in on a compared to august these indicators rose by and regarding investment civil construction inputs production reduced in while capital goods production declined seasonally the monthly contraction of capital goods production does not represent a change in the in view of the intense expansion in this evidenced by a growth in the first seven months of and in the last twelve in the year through compared to the same period of domestic production of capital goods increased with significant in the production of capital goods for energy for mixed use and for construction production of capital goods for agriculture expanded by in the same while trailing production reached in after in confirming the recent good performance in this industrial production reduced in according to monthly industrial survey seasonally adjusted after nine months of consecutive on a moving average which attenuates punctual industrial activity increased in expanding for the thirteenth consecutive industrial production rose by compared to july and expanded by in the first seven months of and in the last twelve among use production of durable consumer goods increased while other categories posted the following reductions in the and goods production capital goods production and intermediate goods production in the year through production of capital goods expanded by sustaining industrial expansion since the beginning of the followed by durable consumer goods intermediate goods and and goods disaggregated data of seasonally adjusted industrial activity showed that the growth in the industrial production reflects that out of the sectors surveyed grew in with highlights to machines and equipment motor vehicles basic metallurgy and other chemical products the main negative drivers were electronic material and communication equipment still considering the industrial according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the hours worked in production expanded by and real industrial sales increased in in the year through these indicators increased by and compared to the same period of after seasonal installed capacity utilization reached in up from in considering observed utilization level reached above the july according to vehicles production reached thousand units in a new monthly according to data seasonally adjusted by the vehicles production expanded by on a and compared to july considering the seasonally adjusted domestic sales increased by and by in compared to the first seven months of vehicles production increased by in and domestic sales increased by while exports decreased according to the same comparison production of agricultural machines grew and production of trucks grew mirroring increases in investment and recovery of the agricultural sector in the current according to the the july estimate for the grains harvest pointed to a increase in national production of grains should reach million due to good weather conditions and the production incentive driven by the increase in international agricultural commodities in the the main forecast production increases related to wheat cottonseed corn and soy while the main production decrease related to rice if other products are besides the survey pointed to a decrease in the coffee mainly due to the biennial negative and increase in sugar cane reflecting the expansion in planted boosted by the growing interest in ethanol surveys and expectations the monthly survey showed a increase in the consumer confidence index in the two icc components presented divergent with the consumer expectation index increasing in and the current economic conditions index declining by in the icea remained above the iec for the eighth consecutive compared to august icc and icea increased by and while the iec decreased by according to the fgv which encompasses two thousand homes in the seven main state capitals of the the icc increased in this result is due to the improvement in both the of the present situation and in the ahead expectations compared to august the icc rose mainly because of the increase in the present situation still according to the the industry confidence index increased to in august from in reaching a new record high for the series started in april the ici rose relative to august expanding by in the first seven months of the compared to the same period of among the items in the ici related to the present it bears highlighting for the first time since april the share of surveyed participants that evaluate inventories as insufficient outpaced the share of those which evaluate inventories as the level of installed capacity utilization reached in up from in august according to the july manufacturing industry survey special of the surveyed institutions affirmed to have invested more in fixed capital in the first half of than in the previous while responded the as in the survey investment projections for this period pointed to and the new survey indicates acceleration of investment in the second quarter of the for the second half of of the surveyed institutions keep their projections of investment while intend to invest in the capital goods and construction material investment intentions seem to have while intermediate goods producers remain willing to labor market according to the ministry of labor and thousand new formal jobs were created in in the year through thousand new jobs were a increase compared to the same period of these new hirings raised employment by according to the same comparison reaching all major sectors of with highlights to employment expansions in civil construction and in commerce in the seasonally adjusted the employment index increased in also spread among all according to the ibge employment survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate stood at in july down from in the previous this decline was due to the increase in employed population and the stability of economically active population employment in the private sector increased in reflecting the expansion in the number of formal workers and the reduction in the number of informal the number of employers declined while workers decreased by in the year through compared to the same period of the average number of employed workers expanded by mainly due to the increases of and in formal employment and the same survey showed that real average earnings reached in a decrease compared to the same month of last real average earnings increased in july and in the year through real payroll decreased by in july but expanded by relative to the same month of last year and in the year through according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in in the first half of the this figure expanded by while real manufacturing payroll raised according to dieese wage negotiations were carried out in the first half of when workers obtained the best results since the beginning of these in in different around of the negotiations led to wage raises above the inpc consumer price while other negotiations equaled the index wage adjustments have been favored by economic growth and low and stable which allow full and

year and in the last twelve earmarked credit operations expanded and in twelve while credit operations increased by and according to the same comparison on a trailing among credit leasing operations should be highlighted due to the and expansions observed in credit to individuals and to corporate concerning earmarked the significant increases related to housing and the agricultural sector

according to data recently the us economy recovered in the second with a annualized japan and euro area economies sustained their growth with signs that their respective domestic demands have become more significant in this emerging led by fast growth in india and also showed robust favored by high liquidity e increasing commodities the turmoil caused by us subprime mortgages in affected the credit market and other spread risk aversion and reduced international as a overall outlook became highly causing significant falls and massive sales in stock lower global liquidity and some decline in energy and commodities under these the main central banks carried out important shortterm open market aiming at keeping their respective basic interest rates close to the a lot of uncertainties still affect the and it is not clear the time they will take to overcome concerns about the subprime market and broader issues regarding the us credit market will continue to drive the normal related to economic indicators and the coming decisions of the main central will also be injecting volatility until the extension of the problem becomes particularly in relation to the financial effects of subprime there is some consensus that the subprime mortgages crisis will hit the real sector of us economy and affect the but the consequences over global economy tend to be less trade and international reserves between january and brazilian external trade confirmed the ongoing and reached record highs both in exports and in the trade surplus reached billion in the period and billion in twelve while the external trade amounted billion and in the same exports totaled billion in with a million daily above the august and primary products reached daily averages of billion and totaling increases of and over august daily imports totaled billion in a record high for the with a million daily a increase over the same month of all import categories measured in daily especially capital and consumer which increased and raw materials and fuels and lubricants grew by and according to the same comparison at the end of international reserves totaled increasing billion in the billion in the and billion compared to august money market and open market operations after the july copom the yield curve shifted strongly particularly the influenced by the worsening of the us subprime mortgages market which effects impacted the market credit and the international the concerns regarding the contagion gripping to the real sector and the increase of the risk aversion drove the migration to safer which consequently led to brl the fall of the ibovespa de valores de são paulo and the brazilian country risk the coordinated action of several central which provided liquidity to the interbank and the fall of the discount rate of the federal reserve on august contributed to soften the stress in international financial markets as a the partial downward move of the yield between july and september and rates fell and while the rate increased in and rates also increased and real interest rates measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectations grew to on september from on july in its open market the bcb carried from july to september weekly and sevenmonth long fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations amounted of which billion were in the same the bcb also conducted overnight repo operations aimed at draining the excess liquidity from the on july august and august the bcb also conducted borrowing operations with tenures of and working in the bcb conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to two working operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged between july and september the national treasury raised a total of of which billion in billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in issuance of reached for securities maturing in and of which billion were settled in other national treasury in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in april and october and bought ltns maturing in october and ltns or maturing in january these operations totaled the treasury conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in totaling and bought lft maturing in the treasury also conducted auctions to buy and amounting million and monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index changed in percentage points above the one recorded in february and above the one recorded in january as a inflation in twelve months decreased to in february until february market prices changed in twelve months until february and regulated until february among market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months in february and the prices of in february on its the prices of the food and beverages impacted by weather increased in the same period in february and the prices of services rose until february in available information suggest some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in january to in as a on a trailing inflation reached above the one registered until february the double weight core inflation changed in january to in the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from to the trimmed means core from to and the core by which excludes ten household food items and from to on its the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to the diffusion index stood at in february below the one recorded in february the general price index increased in after increasing in and on a month trailing basis in the twelve months through february the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months until february with increase of in the prices of agricultural products and of in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through february until february the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed until february partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in february and in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimate for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in january the seasonally adjusted changed and the composite purchasing index regarding brazil pointed to acceleration of the economic activity in with expansion both in the manufacturing sector and in the services on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation stood virtually unchanged between febuary and march and remains below the historical average of the on the other the industrial businessmen measured by the industry confidence index decreased in march and reached the lowest level since june after the third fall in the the index remains below the historical average for the consecutive the services confidence index also retreated in regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the the gdp increased in the fourth quarter of after decreasing in the previous according to data seasonally adjusted by the it expanded by to in the third the brazilian economy increased in from the aggregate demand household consumption increased in the fourth according to seasonally adjusted and compared to the same quarter of representing the consecutive expansion according to this comparison on its the government consumption increased at the margin and compared to the last quarter of on the other the fixed capital gross formation increased compared to the previous quarter and compared to the same quarter of the industrial activity increased in after increasing in according to the seasonally adjusted released by the industrial production grew in february interrupting two months of consecutive negative rates in december and in january with highlight for the production of automotive which increased in the month consecutive positive the industrial sector maintained the improvement in its productive expressed not only by the second consecutive positive result in the comparison with the immediate previous but also by the widespread profile of positive since out of the surveyed activities expanded their production in the pmi of the industrial sector indicates little expansion in with increase in the amount of new according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased between january and february according to the seasonally adjusted series compared to february among the use the production of durable consumer goods and capital goods registered increase of two digits in according to the monthly interannual the semi and and intermediate goods production also and regarding growth accumulated in the twelve months up to there were expansions in the production of capital goods and durable consumer goods and retreats in the production of intermediate goods and semi and consumer goods according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate without seasonal adjustment reached a record low for february since the beginning of the in and represents a reduction of compared to the rate observed in february according to the bcb seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached still according to the the average real income increased in while real payroll increased according to the same comparison data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were created in the net creation was above the one observed in february in the available data indicate narrow idleness margin in the labor although there are some signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume increased by in compared to january on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction increased by in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the broad retail sales growth rate was with expansion in eight out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the retreated in mainly due to the perception of the current the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in march in march according to the seasonally adjusted series calculated by the the nuci in march reached the utilization capacity in the capital goods sector stood at in the sector of consumer intermediate goods and construction the utilization capacity stood at and on its the absorption of capital goods grew in the last twelve months through the trailing trade balance result reached billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with advances of and compared to the twelve months through february on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the on the other foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with advanced and emerging specifically about despite recent high unemployment rates coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties still constitute elements constraining investments and in the emerging some deceleration in the growth pace is regarding the monetary the federal reserve continued the process of gradual reduction of the assets purchase in accommodative stances prevail in the advanced in the emerging the monetary policy is less and in some it is inflation remains at moderate or low levels in the in the euro zone and in the price of the brent oil barrel remained at a level near since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have increased while those relative to metals have decreased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations retreated in the twelve months through february of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in compared to considered in the february copom this projection considers gasoline and bottled gas price changes and until as well as assumptions of stability in fixed telephone tariffs and the increase of in electricity the items for which there are more available information were projected individually for the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for compared to in the last copom the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis point and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus that derives from the primary surplus both for and is considered as the fiscal according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased to from for the median of the inflation projections increased to from the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the february and remains above the inflation for according to both the inflation forecast increased relative to the value considered in february copom meeting and it stands above the midpoint inflation policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the based on positive data recently the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have in there are improvements in advanced including countries from the euro in the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee also highlights despite recently observed localized the prospects indicate moderation in the dynamics of prices in the international as well as in the currency there is evidence of tension and the copom evaluates that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to remain relatively stable this compared to as well that recent information in the relevant horizon for the monetary changes in the composition of aggregate supply an the copom notes that the domestic absorption expands at rates higher than gdp growth rates both are and tends to be among other by the effects of fiscal policy the moderate expansion of credit supply of credit to the program of public services concession and the one related to the permission for oil in this the consumption tends to continue albeit at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent and investments would gain regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates that more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture are emerging and considering the relevant horizon for the monetary the services sector tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and of their resulting gains depends on the strengthening of and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables and the arising of the conditions so in the relevant horizon for monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation on the one would contribute to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth on the other it would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it should also be emphasized that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum wage this year is not as significant as in the previous and considering the occurrence over the recent quarters of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost the committee considers that the exchange rate depreciation and volatility observed in the recent semesters enable a natural and expected correction in relative for the the movements in the local currency to some reflect prospects for the transition of the international financial markets towards among other in terms of liquidity and interest it is also important to highlight for the the aforementioned exchange rate despite the recently observed constitutes a source of inflationary pressure in shorter the localized pressures that in the fresh food segment should be in they stem from a temporary shock that tends to revert in the upcoming the copom evaluates that the high consumer inflation level in the last twelve months contributes for inflation to still show by the has been slightly above the level that was in this the formal and informal indexation mechanisms and the economic perception regarding the inflation dynamics are also considering the damage that the persistence of this process would cause to the process on consumption and in the it is necessary with the due it be in this the copom considers that it is appropriate to adjust the monetary the copom unanimously at this to increase the selic rate by to without the committee will monitor the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next so that it then defines the next steps in its monetary policy the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively on the one household consumption tends to continue expanding at a moderate due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial concession of public broadening of oil exploration among other suggest expansion of these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the considering the brazilian experience under the inflation target infers in the trajectories of important economic indicators during the current adjustment cycle of the selic as well as the outlook for these trajectories in the upcoming come in line with what one would the available information suggest that the monetary impulses introduced in the economy since april have usually propagated through the main transmission channels and that tend to continue in the upcoming in this as the effects of monetary policy actions on inflation are cumulative and manifest themselves with the committee understands that a significant part of the response of prices to the current monetary tightening cycle will still it is plausible to claim in the presence of relatively modest confidence the effects of monetary policy actions tend to be the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on may for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june update of economic outlook and baseline the set of indicators of economic activity released since the last copom meeting remains consistent with a gradual recovery of the brazilian the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indices in the unemployment the global outlook has been as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery without pressuring financial conditions in advanced this supports risk appetite towards emerging inflation developments remain with various measures of underlying inflation running at low this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations collected by the focus survey edged up to around for and remained around for expectations for are around and expectations for are around the path of administered prices underlying the inflation scenarios produced by the committee assumes increases of for and for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and and interest rates of per annum at the end of during most of ending that year at under these the inflation projections for and retreated to around and increased to around unless explicitly stated this update takes into account the changes that have occurred since the july copom meeting risks around baseline inflation scenario the baseline scenario involves risk factors in both on the one the combination of possible effects of the ongoing favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of the low level of current including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the inflation path over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic in light of available they all agreed with the diagnosis that the process of stabilization of the economy has they also agreed that economic activity should remain on a gradual recovery whose first signs are already they assessed as the recovery consumption growth should give way to a resumption in they also judged that there are signs of employment recovery even in this phase of the regarding the global members of the committee confirmed the recent favorable evolution of the global with gradual recovery of without pressures on financial conditions in developed they discussed the risks associated with the monetary policy normalization process in central economies and with the outlook for the chinese with possible impacts on risk appetite for emerging in this the copom members reaffirmed that the brazilian economy shows greater capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in the global given its bank of brazil balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospect of economic the copom members pointed out the risk for the brazilian economy of a reversal in this benign global outlook in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian the copom members analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent years and agreed that the prospects for inflation continue to evolve in a favorable considering the scenario that conditions on paths of the interest rate and exchange rate extracted from the focus projections for inflation stand around in december in the same which assumes an interest trajectory that reaches at the end of falls to at the start of and increases to at the end of that the inflation trajectory reaches in december the committee members discussed the dynamics of food whose favorable behavior persists so they analyzed in the twelvemonth period ending in august the cost of food at home measured by the ipca fell by in contrast with the increase of in this represents a contribution of more than two percentage points for the disinflation observed through august they pointed out that a retreat in food price inflation was expected for when compared to but they agreed that this sharp drop in food prices constitutes a substantial disinflationary surprise and accounts for a relevant share of the difference between the inflation projections for and the respective the committee members analyzed the prospect for the future evolution of food price they confirmed the prescription that monetary policy should fight possible effects stemming from this they pointed out that inflation projections for the ones extracted from the focus survey and those from the copom conditional consider some normalization of food price a slower normalization constitutes a downward risk to these the copom members discussed the low levels of current including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary they observed that these low levels have allowed an increase in the purchasing power and contributed to the economic they also observed that the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of the low level of current inflation may lead to a prospective inflation notwithstanding this the copom members considered that the of the economy acts in the opposite by gradually pushing inflation towards target over the copom assessed that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks on both on the one to the risk that side effects of the food price shock and the propagation of the current low level of inflation may produce prospective on the other to the inflationary risk stemming from a possible reversal of the global in a context of frustration of expectations regarding adjustments and the committee members expressed the understanding that economic with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures running at low inflation forecasts slightly below target for and high level of economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of the committee members expressed an understanding that current real interest rates already provide stimulus to the the copom understands that the evolution of such as the recently approved credit policy and of adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over the committee understands for a given estimate of the length of the monetary easing the pace of easing depends on the stage of the without necessarily reflecting changes in the baseline scenario or in the balance of all copom members agreed that the evolution of the outlook and of the balance of risks since its july meeting was compatible with the reduction of the selic rate to percent per the committee members then discussed the next step in the conduct of monetary in this they assessed the convenience of signaling the possible magnitudes of monetary easing at the next they argued for the need to maintain flexibility for monetary policy to properly react in case of changes to the baseline scenario and the balance of the members also discussed the appropriate pace of easing at the current stage of the they concluded in favor of that if the outlook evolves according to the baseline and due to the stage of the easing a moderate reduction in the bank of brazil of monetary easing at the next meeting seems from the current the committee members also assessed the convenience of signaling the possible steps after the next in they assessed the costs and benefits of a gradual ending to the easing in the committee members agreed everything else there are benefits from a gradual ending of monetary a gradual process facilitates communication and allows gathering of more evidence regarding the behavior of the economy around the end of the but they also agreed in exceptional the need for prompt frontloading of the cycle may bring greater benefits than those related to a gradual in the current the copom judged convenient to signal if the baseline scenario evolves as currently the committee foresees a gradual ending to the current monetary easing the committee members reaffirmed their preference for communicating conditionalities for the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality that guides their this contributes to increase transparency and improve copom in this they once again highlighted that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation forecasts and all committee members reemphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of fiscal nature and of adjustments in the brazilian economy are fundamental to the sustainability of an environment with low and stable to the full operation of monetary policy and to the reduction of its structural interest with widespread benefits for the committee members highlighted the importance of other initiatives as the recently announced privatizations and and investments in infrastructure aimed at productivity efficiency greater flexibility of the and business environment these efforts are fundamental for the resumption of economic activity and for the development path of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate by one percentage to without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the target over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes is compatible with the monetary easing the committee judges that economic conditions prescribe accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural the copom emphasizes that the evolution of such as the recently approved credit policy and necessary adjustments to the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over the copom emphasizes that economic conditions have allowed the same pace of monetary easing at the current regarding the next copom provided that the baseline scenario evolves as and due to the stage of the monetary easing the committee views a moderate reduction of the pace of easing as appropriate at this in under those same the copom foresees a gradual ending to the notwithstanding these the copom emphasizes that the monetary easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the and on inflation forecasts and the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac sidney menezes luiz edson otávio ribeiro reinaldo le sidnei corrêa marques and tiago couto ipca after moving from in january to in reduced to in as a inflation accumulated in the first quarter of reached above the level registered in the same period of the previous the rise in inflation in mirrors the behavior of both market which increased by in the year through and regulated focusing on market both prices of tradable goods and goods accelerated in the first reaching and up from and on its regulated prices increased by in the first three months of the compared to in the same period of the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of reached until march and in twelve preliminary data for april point to consumer inflation above that observed in in information available suggests deterioration of inflation dynamics at the the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb showed divergent behavior between february and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in february to in while the core inflation by exclusion and double weight core inflation measures reduced and in to and in in the year through the core inflation by exclusion increased by while smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation measures increased and these changes and above the rates prevailing in the same period in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december for the core inflation by smoothed trimmed means and double weight core inflation to and in it is important highlighting that all core inflation measures continued to increase on a and are above the midpoint of inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index increased from in february to in march to in march from another the diffusion indices suggest dissemination in the inflation acceleration the general price index inflation decreased from in february to in in the year through the inflation reached in the first quarter of under this comparison the acceleration of the reflected the behavior of its three the wholesale price index increased in the first quarter of in on its the consumer price indexbrazil increased in the same period in still according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in the inflation under this comparison derived mainly from the behavior of agricultural while the industrial ipa increased in the elevation of wholesale agricultural prices reached in as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand as well as on price expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output moved from in january to in still considering the seasonally adjusted on a after expanding by in industrial output increased by in on a industrial output increased by in up from in on a trailing decline in industrial production is still observed but it has been reduced in december and in the behavior of ibge industrial output and its shows that industrial production expands at a pace that continues to be influenced by the international by business and households as well as by domestic financial this process is supported not only by traditional sources of but also by the recovery of capital markets and the performance of public financial among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the in february it bears highlighting the expansion of in capital goods and in and consumer goods which increased durable consumer goods production increased intermediate goods production declined after rising and in december and it bears highlighting that capital goods productions expanded by in the quarter ended in the most remarkable expansion the use the recovery in industrial production dynamism was initially led by the production of durable but it has become even more widespread than reflecting tax exemption in advanced process of as well as the easing in financial conditions and the income the future behavior of industrial which should not be uniform over will also depend on the evolution of consumer and businessmen which should continue to be sources of to which will be added the recovery of external labor market continues to show favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey increased from in january to in lower than that observed in the same month of last according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate reached in down from in the previous average real earnings increased in after increasing by in on its increased by in january and in as a real payroll expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that formal employment has continued to in thousand jobs were created in march in the first quarter of both record highs for the historical the manufacturing services and civil construction for the third consecutive record highs for the month registered the best first quarter for the historical series thousand and the most dynamic sector continues to be civil where employment recorded a increase in the first quarter of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after increasing by in on a the indicator increased in the threemonth moving average of expanded retail sales reached in according to seasonally adjusted after reaching in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of pharmaceuticals and medical articles and clothing and shoes expanded retail sales data have been evidencing mainly influenced by the increase in the sales of durable in response to the improvement in the access to credit income expansion and temporary sector incentives granted by the the retail sector continues to register positive performance and indicates that the pace of domestic demand growth remains showing no signs of for the next the retail sales trajectory will be benefited by fiscal by real payroll by the recovery in the access to credit and by the evolution of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in above the level registered in the same month of according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci showed stability in february according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reached in march in the previous above the average observed in the last five the nuci in the consumer construction material and capital goods industries in march in the same and above the respective averages for the historical started in on its the intermediate goods industry is slightly below the historical the reduction in the idle capacity is a result of economic activity not totally offset by the maturity of investment data regarding the absorption of capital goods showed recovery compared to the same periods of and increase in february the absorption of capital goods increased in according to seasonally adjusted a increase in but an decrease in the last twelve on its the production of construction inputs expanded by at the margin in after recording stability in according to observed it increased in accumulating a fall in the last twelve in evidences suggest that the utilization rates have recorded upward trajectory in the last showing reduction in any remaining idle margin of the despite the recovery of as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance retreated at the reaching a billion surplus in billion lower than the one obtained in the same period last this total resulted from in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to the external demand contributes to the narrowing of the trade the increase in remittances of profits and dividends contributes to elevate the trailing current account which reached billion in up from billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was initially marked by the continuity in the process of normalization of activity in international financial markets more by some increase in the volatility of asset although the perception of systemic risk remains these developments can be attributed to fiscal concerns in mature notably in under these there was some moderation in the demand for risky as evidenced by the behavior of international financial given the fiscal concerns in the euro the emphasis in the currency market remained the depreciation of the regarding the global macroeconomic the current predominant view points to the recovery in and acceleration in in a process where the europe and japan would recover some but which would continue to be led by emerging the us economy shows signs of gradual due to the improvement of conditions in labor market and industrial on its the economic activity in japan continues to suggest a slow led by especially to in the euro where fiscal concerns persist and where household consumption shows no signs of the economic recovery has been slower and in uncertainty regarding the sustainability of consumption expansion in mature economies still mainly in in a scenario of withdrawal of economic policy stimuli and modest prospects for credit but the recovery shows some on the other in many emerging economic activity seems to have embarked on a consistent path of in some evidence of heat in the markets of production factors and inflation troughs in mature economies and major emerging economies have been in this after a period of aggressive monetary policy in several monetary policy continues a phase of whereas those economies that were less impacted by the international crisis and recover more quickly and intensely tend to adopt more restrictive monetary policy australia and for recently raised the basic interest oil prices both for spot and future despite with reduced since the last copom uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of in a context of global economic on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the pace of investment maturation in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can eventually affect domestic prices both through production such as the and through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact on the evolution of food have presented stability since the previous copom while the industrial commodities prices have registered slight except for nickel and iron which have notably increased since the last copom of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottle gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone was kept at for while the projections for electricity prices adjustments was reduced to for down from considered in the march the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual reduced to down from considered in the march according to the benchmark this set of according to data released by accounted for of the total march the projection for regulated prices inflation for was maintained at on the benchmark such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be reduced by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refer to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to of the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations also from to the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered in the march copom and continues to be significantly above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also standing significantly above the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection increased relative to the figure considered in the march copom and is significantly above the inflation midpoint under the market the projection also however it stands around the midpoint monetary policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in international risk aversion has improved since the last copom despite the intensification of volatility in these markets in recent largely due to concerns about the sovereign debt of european there is a context of abundant so that the prospects for external funding for the brazilian economy remain in line with these both the prices of brazilian assets and of some selected commodities have continued to on the other the trajectory of price indices evidences the resumption of inflationary pressures in relevant the benign impact of the international scenario over the domestic inflation path could come to an despite the persistence of uncertainty regarding the behavior of asset and commodities prices in the context of gradual normalization of international financial on the other this scenario may be quickly depending on the dynamics that derives from the market distrust regarding the solvency of some european regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook the copom reaffirms that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom believes that the indicators released since the last meeting reinforce the perception about the existence of pressures over the market of increasing the probability that initially localized inflationary episodes pose risks to the inflation in this the risk of of upward costs pressures to wholesale price and from the last to consumer price increases as the committee states that the materialization of this as well as the spread of initially localized pressures over consumer continues to depend critically on the economic expectations for inflation and on the idleness degree of the among other these and other variables are part of the information set that is taken into account in the generation of inflation forecasts of the which constitute a key element in the assessment on the prospective inflation it should be noted that the behavior of domestic demand has exerted some pressure over the prices of such as considering the perspective for the evolution of the main factors sustaining aggregate tends to be observed again in this in the upcoming in any the committee reaffirms the commitment that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom considers important to once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current inflation the prospective suffered some deterioration at the start of a dynamic that has become even more evident since the last this occurred despite specific moves of some domestic which are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain as evidenced by data on manufacturing capacity utilization and the labor this assessment is also supported by signs of continued expansion of credit both for individuals and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high and by income the continuity and intensification of this outlook depends significantly upon the effects of fiscal stimulus measures and the additional governmental transfers that will occur in the upcoming months to a lesser upon the pace of recovery in global the dynamism of domestic activity should also be benefited by the easing of financial among other by the policies of official considering the brazilian new cycle of these considerations become even more relevant when one takes into account that there are lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects over the activity level and the copom believes that the main risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario regarding the external from additional rises in commodities prices regarding the domestic from the fiscal and credit impulse over the evolution of domestic in the context of virtual exhaustion of the idleness margin in the use of production these developments may exacerbate an outlook that already evidences the presence of mismatch between the growth of domestic absorption and capacity of supply international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase of risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the copom strategy aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the committee believes that the economy is in a new expansion and this assessment is corroborated by data released since its last although uncertainty about the pace of this process which should be resolved over time still signs of overheat in the economy are for in core inflation in the rise of inflation in the evidence of workers shortage for some sectors and in the rising inputs in during this the inflation projections considered by the committee showed some deterioration in the prospective the copom believes that this deterioration should be contained the signs of persistent mismatch between the pace of aggregate demand expansion and aggregate tend to increase the risk for inflation must be in such the monetary policy stance should be on the one because it contributes to the convergence between the pace of demand expansion and supply on the other because it prevents that originally localized price pressures determine a persistent deterioration of the inflation prospective in despite the withdrawal of substantial share of the stimuli introduced during the recent international financial since the last the risks for the achievement of a benign inflationary in which inflation would remain consistent with the inflation have in light of this the prevailing among the committee members was that monetary policy must act incisively in order to avoid that the greater uncertainty detected in shorter horizons spread to longer under these continuing the adjustment process of monetary conditions to the prospective scenario of the in order to ensure the convergence of inflation to the targets the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate to without under the the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a brief domestic demand largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit on its important fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in recent and should contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion for the reduction of any residual idleness margin of productive the effects of these as well the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent international financial and a possible deepening of the fiscal crisis that several european countries are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure a timely convergence of inflation to the targets in it bears noticing that there was consensus among the committee members about the need to adapt the pace of adjustment of the basic interest rate to the developments in the prospective inflation as well as to the corresponding balance of in order to limit the impacts caused by the behavior of current inflation over the underlying prices at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on june for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca increased in down from in accumulating a increase in the year through in the last twelve the index increased in up from in the behavior of food and beverages prices constituted the key driver of inflation in contributing to the in particular due to the change in roots and pasteurized refined sugar and which jointly contributed to the march ipca despite the pressure stemming from food and the ipca cooled in mainly favored by the depletion of the impacts caused by school fees which had pressured the index in the deceleration in market price from in february to in reflected the slowdown in goods which reached in down from in while the prices of tradable goods rose in up from in the previous regulated prices fell in the after rising in reflecting mainly the decrease in the price of in the last twelve months through market prices rose the highest change since may up from through while regulated prices increased against for the same the diffusion index stood at in up from the previous confirming the dissemination process of price the ipcaex which excludes all fuel items and ten items of household decelerated in march to down from in in twelve it reaching in up from in the smoothed core measure both for the monthly increasing in march up from in and for a trailing reaching compared to in the previous the double weight core increased by in the down from in increasing on a trailing up from in the decelerated in increasing by down from in favored by the cooling in wholesale price whose impact overweighed the resurgence of highs in consumer price inflation and construction the expanded by in the year through march and in the last twelve the increased in down from in registering increase for agricultural prices and decrease for industrial prices in the year through the increased and in the last twelve it rose the grew in up from in accumulating in the year and in twelve in the three of the seven groups that compose the with emphasis on food accounting for in the composition of the monthly especially fruit and which contributed the increased in up from in the previous with highlights to the greatest change in the prices of the labor which increased up from in in the year through march and in the last twelve the index expanded by and partial results of price indices indicated continuity in the process of inflation deceleration in among other the depletion of seasonal impacts in for the increase in inflation at the start of the the increased up from in the previous mainly reflecting the behavior in the prices of which decreased in the also influencing the decline in the price of the food and beverages group continued to be the key driver for inflationary contributing to the monthly considering wholesale price there are also less intense due to the cooling in the prices of final and intermediate followed by fall in the

released by the seasonally hours worked and employment rose by and in the same these indicators increased by and on a trailing the three indicators reduced by and according to the nuci remained unchanged at in relative to higher than the level observed in the same month of considering the seasonally adjusted the nuci stood at in compared to in and accumulated a decline of in the quarter ended in in eleven out of the nineteen segments of the manufacturing the nuci presented positive performance according to data from the nuci reached in seasonally with increases of in the month and over the last three according to vehicles production reached thousand units in increasing by according to data seasonally vehicles production increased in in the year and in the last twelve months through the production of vehicles increased and the monthly increase in vehicles sales was exclusively due to the performance of domestic with a increase in while exports fell in the year and twelve months through domestic sales increased and while exports expanded by in the year and decreased by in the last twelve the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in march estimated the production of million tons in up from million tons in the new estimate represents an increase relative to remaining virtually relative to the forecast in the projected expansions for the production of soybeans and corn were changed to and for products directly related to the basic such as beans and the new survey projected changes of and and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index decreased in april for the second consecutive the icc fell in compared to when it had fallen compared to the month when it reached a record high for the this result reflected the fall of in the current economic conditions index considering that the consumer expectations index increased in the the icc increased according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the fgv the icc increased in seasonally reaching in the the current situation index decreased for the second consecutive from to while the expectations index increased from to after three consecutive months of the icc increased

the service sector created thousand jobs in with increases of in the employment level and in the the construction sector was responsible for the supply of thousand jobs during the representing a growth in the level of employment and a increase in the performing as the sector with the highest growth rate according to both comparison according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate reached in increasing and declining the increase in unemployment in the month resulted from an increase of thousand lower than the increase

delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate declined reaching and with declined reaching environment economic indicators released since the last copom meeting have highlighted the continuing process of global economic driven primarily by emerging especially in southeast recent projections by the imf revised global growth to and maintained their expectation for the performance of at growth estimates for related to the us and japan to and while for the euro uk and china projections remained unchanged at and for world the imf raised its forecast for expansion this year to above the last released in in the expectations indicators showed continued rise in consumer while labor market indicators showed positive reflecting the net creation of jobs in the first quarter of the the disposable in suggests that consumption growth in the period had as counterpart a reduction in the savings in the euro where the resumption of activity continues the most recent data evidenced that consumer spending has not shown significant recovery yet and economic activity in the region continues to be driven mainly by the external in larger advanced although the costs to producers respond to the rise in commodities the relatively low installed capacity utilization and the high unemployment rates result in the maintenance of reduced consumer price indices in the last twelve months through reached in the in the euro area and in the among emerging the cpi annual changes recorded in march in in and in in light of this the central banks of major mature economies kept the basic interest rates unchanged and were involved in the management of among emerging signs of reduction of accommodative stance for monetary policy with recent high in the interest rate in india and restrictions to credit in as highlighted in the last copom in face of the fiscal especially in the european tensions in the international economy remained the cds spreads in greece and portugal have recently despite the statement of financial support to greece signed in by the countries that comprise the euro the greek debt was downgraded by a rating and the greek government with the countries that comprise the euro area and the the request for activation of the loan lack of details regarding its implementation maintained the cds in greece at record trade and international reserves the

the balance of borrowing operations in foreign international reserves reached billion in recording a billion growth under the cash international reserves totaled recording a billion according to the same comparison the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic in market and open market operations since the march copom the slope of the yield curve has increased throughout its the persistent rise in inflationary the slow deceleration of current inflation indices and the disclosure of activity and employment data suggesting consistent recovery of economic activity were key drivers of this between march and april and rates increased by and the and rates increased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on march to on april in its open market the bcb carried between march and april repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the

operations for the most recent there was a fall in the repurchase agreements totaling with a decrease in total stock from billion on march to billion on april the main driver of liquidity contraction in the period was the adjustment promoted by reserve between march and april the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of ntnbs reached for securities maturing in and monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index changed in percentage points above the one recorded in september and above the one recorded in august as a inflation in twelve months reached in september in september market prices changed in twelve months in september and regulated in september among market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months in september and the prices of in september on its the prices of the food and beverages group increased in the same period in september and the prices of services rose until september in available information suggest some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in august to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in september the double weight core changed from in august to in the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from to and the core by which excludes ten household food items and from to on its the trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to and the smoothed trimmed means ipca core from to the diffusion index stood at in september above the one recorded in september the general price index increased in august and in reaching on a trailing basis in september the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in september with decrease of in the prices of agricultural products and increase of in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through september in september the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in september partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in august the changed seasonally the composite purchasing index regarding after pointing to decline in the productivity in august returned to levels indicating moderate expansion in september with the growth in services sector activity offsetting a modest contraction in industrial sector on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation decreased in reaching the lowest level since april the industrial businessmen measured by the industry confidence index and the services confidence index both from increased in october for the first time in the the ici after nine months of was determined by the expectations component in relation to the future the by its despite the monthly reached the second lowest level since march regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the ibge in september indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the industrial activity expanded for the second consecutive by in according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the it was the same growth pace observed in the industrial production fell in according to the observed industrial production decreased in the result was negative in the four economic categories and in out of the surveyed according to the same comparison according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased between july and august according to the seasonally adjusted real revenue is still smaller than the one observed in august the pmi of the industrial on its in reversion of the expansion seen in among the use according to the august and seasonally adjusted data the only increase was observed in intermediate goods on the other the production of durable consumer goods and semidurable and consumer goods decreased and regarding the production of durable consumer capital intermediate goods and semidurable and consumer goods retreated and according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate reached a record low for september since the beginning of the in the figure represents a reduction of compared to august and a reduction of compared to the rate observed in september data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand jobs were created in the smallest figure for september since in the set of available data indicates narrow idleness margin in the labor although there are some signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume fell in compared to august on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction fell in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the restricted retail sales growth rate was and the broad retail sales growth was with expansion in eight out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the increased in but continues in historically low the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in october according to the seasonally adjusted it reached among the industry use the ones showing the highest according to the seasonally adjusted are construction material and intermediate goods followed by durable consumer goods capital goods and consumer goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through the trailing trade balance result reached billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in which diminished and compared to the previous twelve on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the on the other foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary the federal reserve has confirmed the end of the purchase program in accommodative stances prevail in the advanced and emerging inflation remains at low levels in the advanced in the emerging it stands at high the price of the brent oil barrel decreased to a level near since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the fact that supply growth depends on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have fallen and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through september of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in compared to the considered in the september copom this projection considers gasoline and bottled gas price changes until september and as well as assumptions of a reduction in fixed telephone tariffs and the increase of in electricity the items for which there are more information were projected and for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change are for and for the same values considered in the september copom the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis point and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus both for and according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law and in the budget guidelines law project in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for it increased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council in the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the september and remains above the inflation for the inflation forecast increased at baseline scenario and decreased in the market according to both the inflation forecast remained above the inflation target of for the first three quarters of despite the forecasts indicate that inflation enters in a convergence path in both the forecasts also point to inflation above the midpoint target established by policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers the external environment remains for the despite recently released data have been less positive than the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have there are improvements in advanced with recovery of activity in some countries and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the space to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee highlights the evidences of tension and volatility focuses in the as well as the prospects of moderation in the dynamics of prices in the international the copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and gdp rates have and that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this compared to according to the the activity tends to go into recovery trend next the committee evaluates in the medium important changes must take place in the composition of aggregate supply and the consumption tends to grow at a more moderate and the investments tend to gain these together with other currently anticipate a more favorable composition for potencial regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates in the long more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have and that the services sector tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and their resulting gains depend on the strengthening of and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal despite of identifying evidence of fiscal stimulus in the composition of aggregate demand this according to the view the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral zone during the relevant horizon for the monetary the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also bears emphasizing that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit important to highlight the fact after years of strong expansion cooled with the introduction of macroprudential measures at the end of the credit market oriented to consumption has so over the recent quarters it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by and on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the projected adjustment for the minimum this is not as significant as in the previous and the occurrence of real wage changes is more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor productivity over the recent the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustments processes now underway in the economy the realignment of domestic relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee recognizes that these adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts on inflation and reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from given the above the copom considers that since its last among other the intensification of the aforementioned adjustments in relative prices in the economy has made the balance of risks to inflation less part of its members argued that uncertainties still surround the magnitude and persistence of these adjustments and therefore positioned itself in favor at this that monetary conditions remain the majority of the copom members considered appropriate to the monetary in order to at a lower the prevalence of a more benign outlook for inflation in and the decided to raise the selic rate to without by five votes in favor and three votes to maintain the selic rate at without voted for raising the selic rate to the following members of the alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos araújo and sidnei corrêa voted for the maintenance of the selic rate at the following members of the altamir luiz awazu pereira da silva and luiz edson the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively robust in the relevant horizon for monetary on the one household consumption tends to record a moderate expansion due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial the concession of public the broadening of oil exploration among other tend to support the expansion of in exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of greater growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain especially in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on december for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june ipca inflation increased in down from in as a inflation accumulated in the first five months of reached decreasing relative to the level registered in the same period of the previous in the last twelve inflation increased in down from in april in december and in may the deceleration of consumer price trailing inflation in the first five months of the year mirrored the behavior of market as regulated prices considering market both prices of tradable goods and goods cooled on a trailing reaching and in down from and in december and in the same month of the previous according to the same comparison the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of increased from in december to in may in may preliminary data for june point to consumer inflation below that observed in in information available suggest that the inflationary cycle observed last year has been gradually overcome by a process that should continue to be led by the behavior of market while regulated price inflation should show more the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased in the last the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices increased from in march to in april and in smoothed and trimmed means core inflation measures also recording and in and in april and and in the trailing inflation measures changed from and in december to and in for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core evidencing convergence for the midpoint of the it bears emphasizing that the behavior of the ipca diffusion index reduced from in december to in may to in may the general price index inflation changed from in march to in april and in on a trailing the inflation decreased from in march to in april and in compared to in may the slowdown of the has basically reflected the behavior of its main the wholesale price index which decreased from in march to in according to the same comparison basis in may on its the consumer price increased up to may in may and the civil construction national index increased in may regarding the the inflationary under this comparison derives basically from the behavior of both agricultural and industrial the agricultural ipa reached in may while the elevation of wholesale industrial prices reached in may as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation the ibge released information from data showed contraction in under the criterion of cumulative change in the year the same level recorded for the from the aggregate demand expansion was led by public administration which increased gross fixed capital formation contracted and household consumption reached according to the same comparison supported by real the contribution of domestic absorption to output growth was in the first quarter of overweighing the positive contribution of the external from the aggregate supply still according to the the service sector performed with a while all other sectors the gdp deflator measured by market according to the same comparison decreased from in the fourth quarter of to in the first quarter of on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after increasing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted industrial output increased by in april after expanding by in on a industrial output retreated by in with respective falls of and in mining and manufacturing the analysis of the behavior of ibge industrial output series and its at according to data suggests that production reached its lowest level in and was followed by gradual industrial activity recovery continues to be influenced by the international due to its effects both over exports and credit and over business and among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of capital goods increased by in after decreasing in regarding the other use intermediate goods production increased in april and in and consumer goods production increased in april and in while the production of durable strongly influenced by the automotive increased by in after increasing by in the loss of dynamism in capital goods production reflects the persistence of the international financial turmoil and its consequences over business on its the at the in the dynamism of durable goods production exemption tax measures and also some easing of credit the future trajectory of industrial production will depend on these which counterbalance the deterioration of external demand and a remaining process of inventories labor market has continued to record ambiguous combining positive aspects with signs of loss of the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey changed from in march to in april in april according to the seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate decreased reaching average real earnings increased by in in on its expanded by in april and in according to the same comparison as a real payroll reached in march and in continuing to constitute a key driver for domestic demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment decreased by in in and expanded by on a trailing according to data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased by in twelve months and fell in still regarding the labor data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate some recovery in the generation of formal despite below the seasonal in jobs were created to the positive result of in after five consecutive months of job manufacturing industry showed stability in the commerce sector performed positively after four consecutive months of negative jobs were on the other the civil construction sector and the services sector continued hiring workers this and according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales increased by in after increasing in on a the indicator increased by growing by in the the moving average of expanded retail sales increased in according to seasonally adjusted after reaching in on a according to seasonally adjusted it bears emphasizing the expansion in the sales of parts and and the negative key drivers were and and supermarket and food in the cumulative growth was more significant in material and and magazines and after consecutive falls in the last months of expanded retail sales data have evidenced recovery influenced mainly by the increase in the sales of vehicles since the beginning of the in response to the sector incentives granted by the government and to some improvement in the access to vehicle credit for the next the retail sales trajectory will continue to be sustained by fiscal as well as by real payroll whose evolution should be favored by the reduction of but it will also be affected by the recovery in the access to credit supply and by the behavior of consumer the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in above the level observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the and above the minimum level recorded in the series seasonally adjusted by cni showed an increase from to between march and considering the monthly series without seasonal in april the nuci was below the level registered in the same month of on its the monthly nuci without seasonal calculated by fundação getúlio vargas increased in may to below the level observed in the same month of the reduction in the nuci according to the comparison is also in the production of consumer goods intermediate goods capital goods and construction inputs the reduction on the nuci calculated by cni and according to the same comparison seems to be a result of a combination between the maturity of investment projects and accommodation of economic and points to significant increase in the idle capacity margin of the manufacturing regarding the absorption of capital data indicate continuity of retraction and expansion at the the absorption of capital goods increased in according to seasonally adjusted and decreased in according to observed on its the production of construction inputs has been showing relative stability since accumulating a fall in the in evidences suggest that demand pressures over the productive capacity level of the manufacturing industry although the ones regarding the utilization rates have increased in the last as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance retreated at the under this comparison the trade surplus reached billion in april and decreased to billion in this total resulted from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and the adjustment in relative prices and the accommodation in the pace of expansion of domestic demand contribute to the recovery of the trade but the deterioration in the terms of trade acts on the opposite the reduction in remittances of profits and dividends has contributed to limit the current account which reached billion in december decreasing to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of the period since the last copom meeting was marked by the reduction of stress on international financial which originated in the us and but whose impact over emerging economies had been the unprecedented actions taken by the authorities in the us and using a wide range of in order to ensure minimum conditions of operation and liquidity in monetary have moderated the perception of systemic in this there have been signs of reduction in risk but confidence recovery remains fragile and subject to the decrease in both the risk aversion and the scarcity of capital as well as some concern about tax situation in continued to encourage the recovery of both from emerging and mature against the us regarding the global macroeconomic contraction trends prevail over inflationary the currently predominant view points to the contraction of global economic activity in with recovery only in the consensual projections point to an intense retraction of activity in the europe and japan which be totally offset by the economic dynamism of some emerging especially in there are evidences that economic activity in could be with some improvement in disposable income and in demand for durable goods in the us and recovery of confidence of businessmen in europe and real exports in the problems in the international financial system have continued to be aggravated by a cyclical deterioration in the quality of focused on the us and which tends to reinforce the contraction in the financial conditions as a the risk of new intensification in the in mature where inflation expectations are better anchored and economic activity has decelerated considerably and for a longer inflationary pressures have reduced the disinflation process seems to have gained momentum also in the emerging in spite of greater persistence of the inflationary in this monetary policies stances have become highly expansionist and focused on instruments in the mature while the expansionist stance in the emerging economies has been more at the same the authorities in the western europe and asia have been announcing a series of important initiatives aimed at sustaining economic activity through fiscal which could contribute to a gradual economic important to that the estimates on the fiscal costs for macroeconomic stimulus and support packages to the financial sector have been which has caused pressures over the risk assessment of several sovereign even in advanced the increasing signs that global economy would be close to an inflexion as well as the deterioration of public have resulted in the elevation of interest rate forward structure in advanced mature oil prices showed important elevation relative to the levels observed at the last copom future markets quotations also uncertainty concerning these quotations remains as the prospective scenario depends on the evolution of especially in emerging on the prospects for the evolution of global subject to the rhythm of maturation of investments in the in addition to the geopolitical issues that affect the price of this despite the high uncertainty inherent to the projections regarding the trajectory of oil the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged gasoline prices in the rest of it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of domestic gasoline the evolution of international oil prices can eventually affect domestic prices both through productive such as the as well as through the potential effect over inflation it bears emphasizing that the behavior of agricultural commodity which have particularly important impact in the evolution of food such as soybeans and recorded significant increases since the last copom of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations was based in the following similarly to the april copom the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices for were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone for was kept unchanged at relative to the april copom while the expected adjustment for electricity prices was reduced to the projection for regulated prices inflation for based on individual was reduced to down from considered at the april copom this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total may the projection for regulated prices inflation for reduced to against relative to the april copom such projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of and bps in the last quarter of regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and in unchanged from the april copom the additional assumptions considered in the previous meeting remained since the last copom according to the median ipca inflation expectations compiled by the investor relations office the ipca remained relatively increasing from to for inflation expectations remained at considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased relative to the figure considered at the april copom but it is still below the target established by the national monetary council according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the figure considered in the previous copom but is also below the central inflation inflation projection for based on the benchmark scenario increased relative to the last copom meeting but it is still significantly below the inflation on the market the projection for remained close to policy decision the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic the pace of demand expansion has significantly cooled since the third quarter of partially as a reaction to the substantial and generalized economic activity deceleration in other developed and emerging on its the increase in risk aversion and the constraint observed in liquidity conditions prevailing in the international markets continue to impose adjustments in the balance of but show some marginal in since last copom signs of a global risk aversion reduction continue to despite still subject to with impacts on both brazilian asset and commodities prices and also influencing domestic financial it bears emphasizing that the trajectory of price indices still evidences reduction of external inflationary especially in mature but also in some emerging despite the recent increase in commodities the net impact of the global deceleration over the domestic inflation path continues to until predominantly the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in such context is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years are the copom evaluates that the probability that initially localized inflationary pressures may cause risk to the inflationary trajectory has evidences of substantial accommodation of domestic demand and moderation of pressures over the market of despite remaining subject to should reduce the risk of of upward pressures stemming from wholesale prices apart from have showed deflation over the past few over consumer the committee evaluates that the materialization of such as well as the generalization of pressures initially localized over consumer still depends critically on economic inflation inflation expectations for and have remained below the target since the last copom meeting and continue to be closely it is worth noticing according to available domestic demand behavior should exert less pressure over the prices of such as in the upcoming the committee reaffirms that it will continue to conduct its actions in order to ensure that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become the copom once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on economic activity and the evaluation of alternative options for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation such considerations become even more relevant in periods surrounded by heightened the committee reaffirms that specific asset price movements are only relevant for monetary policy if they impact the inflationary prospects for the evolution of economic activity have improved since the last copom although industrial data still partially reflect a process of inventories retreat and the accommodation of external in light of the international crisis effects over domestic financial credit contribution to sustain domestic demand severely diminished although there are some early signs of in particular regarding credit to the severity of the international crisis negatively influenced consumers and businessmen but there are also signs of under such the resumption of economic activity strongly depends on real payroll expansion and on the effects of government transfers that should occur in but it should also benefit from the gradual easing of financial it bears in that the contracting effects of the international financial crisis over the domestic economy dynamism over the context on which monetary policy has been can become persistent as suggested by the recent behavior of capital markets still subject to as well as by certain economic will not be these considerations become even more relevant considering the fact that the current monetary policy decisions will have concentrated impacts in the final months of particularly in the copom understands that the loss of domestic demand dynamism has caused an increase in the idleness margin of resulting in reduction of inflationary on the other the risks to the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario on the short from price adjustment mechanisms that contribute to lengthen inflationary pressures observed in the as evidenced by the behavior in the price of services and regulated items since the beginning of as well if it from the recent trend of increased commodities in the the risk to the inflationary trajectory stems from the cumulative and lagged of the financial conditions easing over the evolution of domestic demand in a context of gradual recovery of the utilization of production the balance of those influences over the inflationary prospective trajectory will be crucial to the assessment of the various alternatives available for the monetary policy international as well as the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates leads to increase in risk both for private and public to the shortening of planning horizons to lower potential economic besides having regressive effects over income the copom strategy aims to ensure that inflation resumes the midpoint target in as established by the and to keep it in a level consistent with the target path for such which should have its results evidenced throughout takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom evaluates in light of signs of economic activity for industrial production labor market and industrial capacity utilization as well as businessmen and consumers and of inflation expectations for relevant the prospects for the materialization of a benign inflationary in which the ipca would resume evolution in line with the target have continued to regarding this the evolution of the scenario is reflected on inflation projections considered by the as well as on inflation expectations set by independent despite the residual margin for an easing the monetary policy should maintain a cautious aiming to assure the convergence of inflation to the targets the committee understands that the demand motivated by tightening of financial conditions and by the deterioration of although some marginal improvement has been observed in both as well as by the global economic activity has created a significant idleness margin of production factors that may not be rapidly eliminated in a scenario of gradual recovery of economic such development should contribute to restrain the inflationary on the other the copom highlights that the significant monetary policy easing process that has been implemented since will have cumulative effects over the economy and will be evidenced after some time the committee evaluates that decisions regarding the evolution of the basic interest rate have to take into account the magnitude of the total adjustment made since whose impacts on several economic indicators will be evident over in such a few copom members considered to be under such to immediately reduce the pace of the monetary easing implementing in a more smooth way the remaining portion of the adjustment the majority of the copom taking into account inflation which have already incorporated the magnitude of the movement already made since at this to maintain the adjustment pace it bears on the other that there was consensus among the committee taking into account the information available so relative to estimates regarding the scope for residual which depends on the prospective scenario for inflation in light of the targets path and on the balance of risks for such the copom also understands that the preservation of benign inflationary prospects will demand that the economy and financial system behavior under a different interest rate level should be closely in such taking into account the inflation prospects relative to targets the copom has decided to reduce the selic rate to without six votes in favor of the monetary policy action while two votes were in favor of reducing the selic rate by taking into account the fact that changes on the basic interest rate have effects over the economic activity and over the inflationary dynamics that accumulate over the committee agrees that any additional monetary easing should be implemented in a more parsimonious the copom will closely monitor the evolution of the inflationary scenario up to its next in order to then define the following steps on its monetary policy under the inflation targeting the copom guides its decisions according to projected the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the dynamics for and the balance of risks associated to the after a long period of domestic demand started to exert a contractionist influence over economic despite the persistence of incentive such as income it bears highlighting that inflation expectations for and remain in a level consistent with the targets it is noteworthy that the deceleration of global economy has generated downward pressures over wholesale industrial under such the monetary policy could be significantly eased since without jeopardizing inflation convergence to the targets if the risk profile deteriorates in such a manner that implies shifts to the inflation prospective basic scenario considered by the committee at this the monetary policy stance will be promptly adjusted to the at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee would reconvene on july for technical presentations and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of august of data analyzed by the copom the ipca increased in down from the and stayed virtually unchanged relative to the april ipca in the last twelve months through the ipca increased down from in the last twelve months through totaling in the the may result was influenced by the increase in the groups personal outlays down from with a contribution for the and beverages and food up from with a market prices increasing in the up from in while regulated prices reached down from in the same on a trailing market prices increased down from in while regulated prices reached up from in the previous the diffusion index reached up from in the core excluding household food items and regulated prices increased in decelerating relative to the increase observed in reaching on a trailing down from in the last the smoothed trimmed means core reached up from in increasing in the last twelve down from in the previous the trimmed means core increased in may relative to the previous month reaching in the last twelve down from in the previous the increased in up from in reaching in the year through may and in the last twelve the ipa price decreased in reflecting the increase in crop and livestock sector prices and the fall in industrial prices on a the ipa increased with a increase in industrial products prices and a decrease in agricultural it bears highlighting significant and continuous deceleration according to a trailing since october when it totaled the decreasing from in april to in totaling in the last twelve the incc increased in up from in reaching in the last twelve the core increased in the up from in reaching in the last twelve economic activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly survey expanded retail which include construction supplies and vehicles and parts and increased in after increasing by in february and in as a expanded retail sales increased in the first the expansion observed in march reflected the increase in the sales of nine out of the ten segments with highlights to the monthly performance of vehicles and parts and pieces as a response to sectoral stimulus conceded by the which enabled the return to september sales sales of construction inputs grew recording the second consecutive monthly the only negative driver was furniture and home appliances the comparison between identical periods of and revealed expansion of in expanded retail sales in march and in the first quarter of in it bears emphasizing the performance of office material and equipment vehicles and parts and pieces pharmaceutical and perfumery products and magazines and stationary the negative drivers were clothing and shoes construction inputs and furniture and home appliances in the it bears noticing the performance of office material and equipment magazines and stationary and pharmaceutical and perfumery products only construction inputs and clothing and shoes fell in sales and são paulo trade association related to the city of são indicated a decrease of on database consultation for credit sales and a increase on consultations to the usecheque system in on a seasonally adjusted those indicators showed in may respective falls of and while in the year through may these indicators reached and automobile sales by which take into account light commercial trucks and decreased in seasonally according to fenabrave federation of auto vehicles sales increased despite the fall in trucks in the year through automobile vehicles sales decreased relative to the same period of with significant fall in trucks sales according to the same comparison automobiles sales fell while light commercial vehicles sales expanded by regarding investment capital goods production and the production of construction typical inputs increased and in according to seasonally adjusted relative to the same period of those indicators decreased and in and and in the year through capital goods imports retreated in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the april indicator increased expanding by in the first four months of compared to the same period of last according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in seasonally the fourth consecutive monthly it bears emphasizing the durable consumer goods particularly automobile vehicles sixteen out of the activities surveyed reported monthly production with highlights to the performance of tobacco electrical devices and materials metal products rubber and plastic electronic material and communication equipment and basic metallurgy all the use categories increased according to this comparison production of durable consumer goods capital goods intermediate goods and and consumer goods industrial production decreased in due to the decline in all use capital goods durable consumer goods intermediate goods and and consumer goods the cumulative industrial production declined in compared to the twelve months through deepening the fall relative to the twelve months through february and when industrial production decreased by and according to the same comparison cni indicators showed a smooth retraction in the industrial activity in with decrease of in real revenues and stability in the hours worked in according to data seasonally adjusted by the the installed capacity utilization increased in the same reaching these indicators decreased and vehicles production reached thousand units in according to decreasing considering seasonally adjusted the production of vehicles decreased in for a decrease in the first five months of this compared to the same period of the cumulative production of vehicles decreased by and the production of agricultural machinery increased in the last twelve months through compared to the last twelve months through domestic sales of vehicles in may accumulating a decrease in twelve while the exports of vehicles decreased and according to the same comparison the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in february pointed to the production of million tons in up from million tons estimated in the new estimate represents a decrease relative to the declines of for the production of corn and of for soybean were also the production of grains directly related to the basic food such as rice and should expand by and the ibge released data for data showed negative growth rates in the first quarter of both for results compared to for and for results as against in the previous according to the on the aggregate supply only the services sector expanded the agriculture sector and the manufacturing industry retreated and on the aggregate demand household and government consumption and whereas gross fixed capital formation decreased resulting in negative contribution of domestic demand to gdp interrupting a cycle of twenty one consecutive quarters of positive exports and imports decreased and resulting in positive contribution of the external sector to gdp the first one after twelve quarters of negative and expectations according to the the consumer confidence index increased in reflecting just a increase in the consumer expectations index considering the decrease in the current economic conditions index the icc declined mainly due to the retraction of in the according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the the icc increased in seasonally representing the third consecutive month of increase and showing a trend towards a gradual recovery of consumer the confidence increase reflected the monthly increase in consumer expectations and current situation the icc declined in relation to the expectations for the manufacturing the fgv manufacturing industry survey in for the fifth consecutive strong improvement in the businessmen although the industry confidence index stood below the level recorded in the period immediately prior to the international financial the ici reached seasonally with increase of reflecting the increases of in the current situation index and of in the expectations index according to the same the installed capacity utilization reached in below the may considering the seasonally adjusted the nuci observed in may stood above the level registered in market according to the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in april after thousand jobs were created in totaling thousand jobs in the first four months of and thousand jobs in twelve among economic the services and the agriculture sectors registered the highest net hires in april thousand and while in the manufacturing industry and the mining sector the dismissals exceeded the hires in seasonally adjusted data showed relative stability in the employment level in the average of the first quarter showed a increase in influenced by the increases of in the construction in the services sector and in the retail whereas in the manufacturing industry it declined according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate reached in april decreasing and increasing the monthly unemployment decrease reflected a decrease in the economically active higher than the number of employed which totaled thousand and thousand the increase in the unemployment rate was driven by the higher increase in the pea than the increase in the number of employed workers a record low since the start of this series in march according to this comparison the same survey pointed out that average real earnings of employed workers decreased in but increased on a accumulating a growth in and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in increasing by in the month and on a trailing this volume corresponded to of compared to december and april credit operations increased in the month and in the last twelve among the which represent a share of in the total of the financial credit operations to individuals increased in the month and in the last twelve while credit operations to corporate decreased in the month and increased in the last twelve earmarked credit operations increased in the month and on a trailing with highlights to the monthly increase in housing the leasing operations in the individuals segment continue losing momentum at the with a reduction of growth on a trailing basis from in october to in considering the segmentation by economic loans to industry decreased in the month and expanded in the last twelve whereas loans to the retail sector decreased and expanded according to the same comparison the average interest rate on credit used as reference for interest totaled in

as reference for interest rates reached days in down from days in the average tenure of corporate credit operations reached days in down from reached in while the average tenure for credit operations to individuals totaled days in up from days observed in delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety reached in a increase compared to delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate and individuals reached and compared to and in net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in up from in the same month of environment although the stress in the international financial markets has been which can be deduced from the reduction of risk aversion the high prices of the the retraction of the spreads of credit default swaps for banks and corporations and the decline in the rates of interbank the conditions of operation of banking systems are still far below the limiting access to the final credit regarding economic the most recent data already suggest that the pace of global economic activity contraction has the us economic for has shown signs of stabilization in household consumption and in the housing the process of inventories particularly in the retail has making room for production recovery in the near on the other the recent hike in oil prices and the continuing rise in the rates of savings and unemployment constitute risk factors for the recovery of the key issue for the medium term is whether the positive signs stemming from financial markets will sustainability in economic regarding despite the hike at the margin for annual the decline in the prices of commodities and the global recession still suggest the reduction of consumer price indices in this the ongoing deflationary for in the japan and and the disinflation for in the uk and in most emerging should still continue over due to the still uncertain recovery of economic activity and the fact that the prices of particularly remain depressed when compared to the levels prevailing a year in the deflationary process is expected to last for some in the where core inflation is expected to retreat to this the in annual deflation since declined in the last twelve months through when the price of energy decreased in the the annual cpi increased in a record low for the series recorded since early considering this in which signs of improvement in stock markets and in some segments of financial markets still coexist with credit weak consumption and inflation central banks from mature and also from emerging continued strengthening measures focused on monetary policy the us federal reserve and the central banks of uk and which already operate with nominal interest rates close to expanded their programs to purchase public or private including the expansion in the range of collateral accepted in funding on the other central banks in europe canada and of emerging except for the bank of where domestic absorption has restricted the expansion of product the monetary policy easing has been made through the systematic reduction of basic interest the basic interest rates of the boc and the central banks of south africa and turkey were reduced to and trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached billion in totaling billion in the first five months of the in the exports reached and decreasing by and on a daily average total external trade recorded in may a decrease on a daily average the decline in exports in may was amplified by the effect of a new comparison due to the regularization of the exports registers recorded during the strike of the brazilian state tax agency auditors between march and april all products categories decreased on a daily average primary products semimanufactured products and manufactured products regarding brazilian it bears highlighting the contraction of intermediate goods and fuels and lubricants which reflected the slowdown of domestic industrial output and the decrease in the prices of oil and byproducts in international based on the liquidity international which encompass the repurchase lines and borrowing operations in foreign reached billion in recording a billion increase in the under the cash international reserves totaled recording a billion increase according to the same comparison market and open market operations in the period between the april and june copom the future interest rates reduced especially interest reflecting the retreat in current inflation the decline in inflation expectations and gdp growth the and rates showed similar also influenced by expectations of an extended monetary policy easing cycle and by an increasing financial inflow coming from foreign after june part of the downward movement of the curve was especially in its long in reaction to the increase in the us treasury bonds yield and the us dollar appreciation in the international noticeably after the disclosure of data on the us labor between april and june and rates decreased by bps and the and rates decreased by bps and real interest by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation decreased from on april to on june in its open market the bcb carried between april and june long fixed rate repo borrowing billion for a the average daily balance of the and sevenmonth operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of working days on april of working days on may of working days on may of working days on may and of working days on may these operations drained from the market billion and the average daily balance of these borrowing operations reached the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of and liquidity management operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged on a daily on april the bcb carried out traditional fx swap auctions for rolling over the contracts maturing on may these operations totaled around of maturing on may the bcb carried out reverse fx swap auctions maturing on june aiming to anticipate the redemption of the traditional fx swap contracts maturing on the same this operation totaled as a the net short position on fx swap contracts reduced from on april to on june in notional between april and june the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the issuance of securities reached being billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in october and april combined with purchases of ltns maturing in july totaling it also conducted auctions to sell lfts maturing in march and in march combined with the purchase of lfts maturing in june and in september totaling the sales of settled in other national treasury securities maturing in and totaled the treasury also conducted purchase auctions of ltns maturing in july totaling update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global fiscal and monetary stimuli in some developed countries promote a robust economic due to economic central bank communication from major economies suggests monetary stimuli will last uncertainty remains high and a new round of market discussion regarding inflationary risks in these economies could result in a challenging environment for emerging turning to the brazilian despite the intensity of the second wave of the recent indicators continue to evolve better than implying relevant revisions in growth risks to economic recovery were significantly the various measures of underlying inflation are above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and the persistence of inflationary pressure was more intense than especially in industrial the slow pace of supply the resilience of demand and implications of the energy scenario deterioration over electricity fares contribute to keeping inflation under pressure in the short despite the brazilian real recent the committee continues to closely monitor the evolution of shocks and their possible as well as the behavior of service prices as the immunization effects over the economy become more the inflation projections in its baseline with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and exchange rate starting at and evolving according to the purchase power parity stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the energy flag is assumed to be remaining at level in december each risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one a possible even if of the recent increase in the price of international commodities measured in local currency would produce a inflation in the baseline on the other further extensions of fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that increase aggregate demand and deteriorate the fiscal path may pressure the risk despite the improvement of debt sustainability the elevated fiscal risk creates an upward asymmetry in the balance of in the direction of paths for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the international the committee assessed that the fiscal and monetary stimuli are promoting robust economic growth and that the latest inflation releases were surprising in several both developed and for the further discussions about the risk of permanent increase in inflation in the united states could result in a challenging environment for emerging the copom noted that inflation of tradable goods in brazil was higher than in several of its peer countries and that this process may reverse in the creating a new downside risk to the recent rise in the weight of tradable items in the inflation index should increase the relevance of this the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they considered that despite the intensity of the second wave of the the latest available data have surprised the duration of the problems of the supply chains were also for the the second half of the year should bring a robust as the effects of the vaccination are felt more the committee noted that median focus survey growth projections were significantly revised and became more optimistic than those in its baseline the committee also assessed that the downside risks to inflation stemming from risks to the economic recovery have reduced the copom members then debated the level of economic although the economic slack as a whole is rapidly returning to the late the committee considered that the pandemic is still producing heterogeneous effects across economic with consequences for recent and prospective inflation the copom judges that economic activity and formal labor market data suggest that the overall slack has declined faster than despite the increase in the unemployment the copom discussed the implementation of monetary considering not only the baseline but also the balance of risks for according to the baseline which uses the interest rate path extracted from the focus inflation projections are in line with the target for the committee judged that despite the more positive recent fiscal risks continue implying an upward bias in the this asymmetry in the balance of risks affects the appropriate degree of monetary thus justifying a path for monetary policy that is less stimulative than the path used in the baseline the copom then evaluated different normalization paths for the selic considering the baseline scenario and the balance of the committee assessed that there be no changes in the inflation conditioning subsequent uninterrupted interest rate up to the level considered imply projections around the inflation target in the relevant a normalization of the interest rate to this level has become the committee decided to communicate this maintaining transparency about the monetary policy path implied in its and reaffirming that this view will be systematically reassessed as changes in inflation determinants or in the balance of risks in light of the revision of the monetary policy path implied in its the committee evaluated a quicker reduction of monetary stimulus already on this considering the various alternative the committee decided that the best strategy would be to maintain the current pace of stimulus reduction but highlighting the possibility of a quicker adjustment in the next in the this strategy has the following two to accumulate more information regarding the traditional determinants of inflation in some of its qualitative the evolution of more inertial as the services sector and the behavior of inflation both from the focus survey and from market to clarify the distinction between transparency about conditional projections and invariant monetary policy the unequivocal commitment of the banco central do brasil is to inflation convergence to its target over the relevant and future monetary policy steps are freely adjusted to this objective as new information becomes indications about the future path of interest whether for the next meeting or for the final are useful elements for understanding the response function of monetary the information obtained in the period between copom meetings modifies the assumptions present in the baseline scenario and in the balance of and naturally changes the future path of interest monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is conssistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full at this the baseline scenario as a normalization of the policy rate to a level considered this adjustment is necessary to mitigate the dissemination of the temporary shocks to the committee again emphasizes that there is no commitment with this and that future steps of monetary policy could be adjusted to assure the achievement of the inflation for the next the committee foresees the continuation of the monetary normalization process with another adjustment of the same a deterioration of inflation expectations for the relevant horizon may require a quicker reduction of the monetary the copom emphasizes that its view will also depend on the evolution of economic the balance of and how these factors affect inflation the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fabio manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca after recording and in september and increased again in to as a inflation accumulated in the first eleven months of reached above the one observed in the same period of inflation increase in reflects the behavior of market which increased by in the year through november and contributed of the recorded in the in regulated prices decelerated and total in the year through down from in the same period of last contributing only to cumulative inflation in the year through regarding market it bears emphasizing that tradable goods inflation reached in the year through while the goods inflation reached the change in the prices of whose dynamics tends to show more persistence than that of the prices of shows some and reached in the year through the acceleration in prices in october and november was greatly due to the elevation in the prices of food and the deviations in food prices trajectory have continued to perform relevant role in the behavior of headline in in the first the ipca showed sharp when the prices of food and beverages increased while in the second period there was relative when the prices of food and beverages retreated the monthly ipca recorded consecutive price increases in the first three months of the last with food and beverages prices increasing by it bears emphasizing that trailing household food price inflation changed from in april to in and increased to in at the same according to the same comparison ipca inflation reached and the recent elevation in food price inflation has partially mirrored domestic and external supply heightened by the high liquidity environment in international financial in line with the evolution of headline the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb increased between september and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation increased from in september to in october and in in the same the double weight core inflation increased from to and and the core inflation by exclusion rose from to and in the year through the smoothed trimmed means core double weight core inflation and the core inflation by exclusion increased and the ipca diffusion which had already reached in increased again to in october and to in the general price index inflation recorded in close to the change observed in september in the year through the inflation reached above the level recorded in the same period of according to the same comparison inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index rose reflecting the increases of and in industrial and agricultural the inflation change above the change recorded in the same period of inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the increased in the year through above the recorded in the same period of under the same inflation measured by the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased also above the rate recorded in the same period of as emphasized in previous copom meeting the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation the index of economic activity of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for products taxes it constitutes an important coincident indicator of economic after registering positive growth rates in all months of until april the which had been showing growing by between may and august this resumed growth in suggesting that the period of most intense cooling activity has after strong retreat due to the industrial activity but has shown some accommodation at levels similar to those observed in the according to data seasonally adjusted the industrial output grew by in and in the threemonth moving average growth rate reached in the period between july and close to that registered in the period the production increased in october and in on a trailing industrial production expanded for the seventh consecutive by in up from in compared to december a record low for industrial production level registered during the crisis recovery up to october totaled this recovery has partially been supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the most important driver in was durable goods which increased by and consumer goods intermediate goods production and capital goods production were recording and on a moving average only consumer goods production reaching for durable goods production and for and nondurable consumer goods capital goods production retreated while intermediate goods production reduced by it bears highlighting although capital goods production decreased at the the expansion in the year through october reached the most remarkable expansion among the use this evidences the robustness in capital goods a relevant factor for economic recovery in the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey decreased from in september to in lower than the observed in october according to observed after reaching in march the observed rate not only retreated significantly until but reached a historical record low for the series begun in march also according to the seasonally adjusted the rate in october reached a new record low for the series measured by the number of employed workers in the metropolitan increased by in september and in data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate that formal employment continues to although october data do not suggest in thousand jobs were compared to thousand jobs registered in october in the year through million jobs were a expansion relative to the same period of and the best result for the period since the start of the the driver for employment in october and in was which contributed with and for job creation in the month and in the real average earnings also reached a record high in october and as a real considering the main expanded by in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand according to the retail monthly survey from the expanded retail sales increased in in august and in according to the seasonally adjusted sales retreated by in after growing in the four previous as a the average of sales increased in the third out of the ten sectors four sectors performed positively in the most important driver was material and with in the next months the retail sales trajectory should continue to be benefited by governmental by real payroll by credit expansion and by consumer expanded retail sales performed positively in all months of the second period of totaling on the other in the same activity recorded according to the industrial output and some according to the industrial activity accommodation did not have a correspondence in retail whose dynamism reflects both the evolution of consumer goods with increase in volume between the first and the second according to data seasonally adjusted by the and the evolution of final products throughout the six first months of the year stood below according to the industrial survey carried out by the national industry confederation the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal reached in down from in standing close to the levels registered prior to the according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the reached in down from in the previous among the four use only intermediate goods industry had a retreating nuci reaching on the other the nuci in capital goods industry increased by reaching no monthly change was observed for the nuci for the construction inputs industry and for the consumer goods industry in according to the cni series seasonally adjusted by the the nuci remained stable at in after reaching in september and in the installed capacity utilization despite at high showed slight the reduced idleness margin is the result of the recent economic activity still not totally offset by the maturity of investment it bears noticing that the absorption of capital goods decreased in october but increased in the year through growth reached evidencing deceleration in capital goods the production of construction inputs increased and in on a trailing expansion totaled as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the cumulative trade balance result totaled billion in billion below the observed in the same period last this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the greater dynamism of domestic demand relative to external demand is relevant for the reduction in the trade the behavior of remittances of profits and which also reflects the growth differential between the brazilian economy and the economy in other has been contributing to elevate the current account which reached billion in equivalent to of up from billion in on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the last twelve months through equivalent to of resulting in a need of foreign funding equivalent to of the global economy recovery continues to be led by a group of emerging whose steady pace of economic expansion is anchored mainly by domestic demand in specific by the export economic recovery has also continued in the us and despite at a more gradual pace than previously the euro in faces different once persistent uncertainties regarding the solvency of some peripheral economies while the pace of expansion continues quite strong in business confidence in a record high since the unification of that on its concluded negotiations on a joint financial assistance package from the european the international monetary fund and bilateral totaling regarding inflation they have remained at very low levels in the countries euro area and despite the extremely expansionist economic policy both at the fiscal and at the monetary in a new effort in this the us announced a billion expansion of the monetary easing program and there is greater chance for an extension of fiscal among emerging it bears highlighting that the bank of china has raised the reserve requirements twice since the last copom tightening monetary policy actions were also observed in south hungary and whereas further easing was recorded in south oil in spot and futures remained near the low predictability of the asymmetric rebound of global the dependence of supply growth on the maturity pace of risky investment projects and the geopolitical complexity of the sector add uncertainty to oil prices the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes unchanged domestic gasoline prices in it bears highlighting regardless of the behavior of local gasoline oil prices swings might affect the domestic for through the petrochemical sector or through the expectations regarding the prices of other it is noteworthy that the price index based on published by the commodity research bureau has varied in recent around record one factor that seems to contribute to the sharp elevations is the rebalancing of global demand from developed countries to emerging where consumption tends to be more intensive in it also bears noticing in the recent the movement of commodity prices seems to have been strongly influenced by wide global in recent there was some cooling in upward especially for agricultural the high volatility observed in commodities prices results from a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to the remarkable volatility in fx of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for gasoline in increased from considered at the october copom to and for bottled gas increased from to for the same for the projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices stand at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone in reduced to down from considered at the october and for electricity prices in reduced to down from for the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity rates stand at and the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual according to the benchmark reduced to down from considered at the october for the projection reduced to down from this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total november the projection for regulated prices inflation in according to the benchmark reached such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and for the third quarter of the estimate is bps regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of a public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in this percentage can be reduced by up to due to the implementation of the projects linked to the growth acceleration program of which refers to amounts to be paid from it is expected that the primary surplus in would without to of gdp to parameters contained in the budget guidelines and to in the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements recently since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations group for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations increased from to and for it stands at the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the october copom and it is remarkably above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin at the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also and it stands considerably above the inflation midpoint for under the benchmark the projection increased relative to the figure considered at the october copom meeting and stands above the inflation midpoint whereas according to the market the projection remained regarding the third quarter of the projections increased in both but remained around the inflation midpoint policy decision the assessment is that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable longerterm macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to projected inflation and based on the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic mainly price it is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and the economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not result in any lasting results for economic growth and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets path in and in the next which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation target regime stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last six at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the fx and inflationary risk premium among other seem to have resulted in significant reduction of the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has increased in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of it should be emphasized that this perception is supported by estimates generated by the macroeconometric models used by the in it is also noteworthy according to of the analysts who responded to the consultation carried out by the the neutral rate in brazil would currently be at levels equal to or lower than the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy in international volatility and risk aversion have remained high since the last copom partially fueled by the increase of global liquidity and by the prospects that this process can eventually concerns about european sovereign debts and the possible deceleration in china have also at the same time that doubs regarding the sustainability of the us economy recovery have the prices of some commodities and brazilian assets remained relatively stable prospects for external funding for the brazilian economy remain the trajectory of price indices evidences the increase of inflationary pressures in some relevant whereas concerns regarding the prospects of deflation in other economies cooled in this the probability of some influence of external disinflation over domestic inflation although uncertainty about the behavior of asset and commodities prices persists in a context of substantial volatility in international financial regardless of how these aspects of the international outlook the copom reaffirms its view that the main challenge of monetary policy is to ensure that the favorable results obtained over the last years be although the accommodation observed in the last two quarters has been more intense than the expected at the start of the as among by data on inventories and industrial the prospects for the evolution of domestic economic activity remain this assessment is among other by signs that the expansion of credit supply tends to despite at a more moderate both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidence stands at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation at the the copom that the dynamism domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor despite the cooling in the generation of jobs in specific the copom once that there are time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects on both economic activity and the assessment of alternative stances for monetary policy should necessarily focus on the inflationary scenario and its instead of current and past inflation since the inflation was strong and negatively influenced by the dynamic of food which in part reflected domestic and external supply these developments tend to be transmitted to the prospective among other through as pointed by the figures considered by the bcb in its inflation it also bears highlighting the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth in this the committee identifies risks to the materialization of a scenario in which inflation promptly converges to the midpoint the copom on the other that the effects of the adjustment process in the base interest interrupted in july completely materialized yet to price at the same reaffirms that the main scenario is subject to the materialization of the trajectories regarding fiscal and parafiscal variables which the committee the main scenario also incorporates moderation in the credit regarding this last since the last the view of a substantial increase in the probability of materializing this hypothesis in light of the introduction of macroprudential the copom emphasizes that there is some equivalence among macroprudential and conventional monetary policy actions and that the importance of this link tends to grow with the deepening of the credit a phenomenon already observed in brazil in the last these two sets of instruments cannot be seen as perfect once they among other regarding scope and transmission the macroprudential actions recently announced are inserted in a wider which among other the reversion of stimuli introduced to outweigh the effects of the crisis over the brazilian together with other they constitute a sequence of initiatives that aim to adequate domestic financial conditions to the characterized by intense contrast among the prospective scenarios for the main economic regarding this once the copom shares the view that the attitude regarding risk taking is one of the monetary policy transmission macroprudential actions may precede conventional monetary policy the intensity and frequency of shocks that both the global and brazilian economies have undergone in the last years impose additional challenges to the analysis of the prospective the committee recognizes an economic environment in which the uncertainty level prevails above the where the risks for the consolidation of a benign inflationary scenario essentially stem from the domestic among these it bears mentioning those deriving from domestic demand in a context of narrow idleness margin in the use of production in a recent a slight decline in the capacity utilization rate and a certain moderation in the dynamism of labor market for public have been in since the last copom in the foreign extraordinary liquidity eases and their in a certain immediate and generalized over assets specially point to lower probability of reversion of the still slow recovery process in which economies on the other these liquidity eases evidence the ambiguous influence of the international scenario over domestic inflation regarding the domestic the effects of selic rate adjustments have not been totally incorporated into price recently announced macroprudential a quick and powerful instrument to contain localized demand will still have their effects incorporated to price since the last copom the materialization of risks which the copom considered at that opportunity has but it revealed to be at a magnitude higher than previously although the uncertainties that surround the global and at a lower the domestic do not allow the clear identification of the lastingness of the recent the current balance of risks is less favorable to the materialization of a benign in which inflation would consistently follow the targets in this after having considered the macroeconomic context and inflation the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without in light of a less favorable prospective than that observed in the last but considering due to credit and liquidity the bcb recently introduced macroprudential among the committee members prevailed the understanding that additional time will be necessary in order to better measure the effect of these initiatives over monetary in this the committee understood it is not opportune to reevaluate monetary policy strategy at this meeting and will attentively follow the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next to then define the next steps in its monetary policy domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although tending to cool fiscal and credit incentives have been provided to the economy in the last and should still contribute for the consolidation of activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness margin of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of substantial share of the initiatives taken during the recent financial crisis and by recent macroprudential these elements are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on january for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in showing acceleration relative to the october but a reduction relative to the result in the index increased by in the year and by in the last twelve months through market prices increased by in the up from in as result of the increases of in the prices of tradable goods and of in the prices of regulated prices increased by up from in the diffusion index reached in november and an average of in monthly and ipca core inflation rates accelerated in the smoothed core inflation increased up from in the previous accumulating in twelve up from in core inflation by which excludes ten items of household food and items related to vehicles grew in up from in totaling and in the last twelve months through november and through the double weight core inflation measure increased by in up from in totaling in twelve up from in the previous the increased in totaling in the year and in twelve in all three components the ipa rose up from in mainly influenced by the high increase observed in the prices of bovines items and meat and fish which jointly contributed for the in the last twelve months through the ipa rose reflecting respective increases of and observed in the prices of agricultural and industrial the ipc increased in up from in with acceleration in four out of the seven surveyed especially in food in the year through and in the last twelve the ipc increased by and the incc increased in up from in reaching in the year and in the last twelve activity the increased in after five months of relative according to seasonally adjusted for the quarter ended in the increased by relative to the quarter ended in according to the observed the increased in the year and in the last twelve after four consecutive months of growth at the expanded retail sales decreased in according to data seasonally adjusted by the monthly survey retail sales continued to grow in the with a increase for the fifth consecutive according to seasonally adjusted sales increased in four of the ten sectors with highlights for the following positive sales of office equipment and material and other items of personal and domestic use among the negative it bears highlighting the retreats of in pharmaceutical and medical articles and in vehicles and parts and the average of expanded retail sales in the third quarter showed a expanded retail sales grew in accumulating increases of in the year and in the last twelve the sales of parts and pieces were the only ones that decreased among sectors that it bears highlighting the sales of office equipment and material construction inputs and other items of personal and domestic use the sales of all ten sectors increased in the especially those relative to office equipment and material furniture and appliances and construction inputs the expanded sales in the last twelve months through also increased by each with highlights to office equipment and material furniture and appliances and parts and pieces automobile sales by including light commercial trucks and increased in according to fenabrave federation of automotive vehicles seasonally adjusted by the with generalized increases in all in the quarter ended in sales increased relative to the quarter ended in a performance mainly driven by automobile sales in the year and in the last twelve months through automobile sales increased and reflecting increases in all with emphasis on light commercial trucks and capital goods imports decreased in according to the funcex quantum seasonally adjusted by the the indicator rose while in the year and on a twelvemonth trailing it increased and compared to the same periods of the previous capital goods production decreased in resulting in a decrease in the quarter ended in according to data from the monthly industrial survey by among the the major production decreases recorded in stemmed from the segments of capital goods for the power sector capital goods for industrial purposes and capital goods for agricultural production among the sectors that recorded increase in it bears highlighting transport equipment and capital goods for serial industrial purposes in the capital goods production grew with emphasis on the production for which increased by construction inputs increased in according to data seasonally adjusted by the central totaling growth in the production increased whereas in the year through october and in the last twelve months it expanded by and disbursements from granted by the bndes reached billion in the year through with a increase the industrial sector was the largest recipient of with participation of of the total released in the followed by the infrastructure sector trade and services and agriculture and the livestock sector industrial production increased in after changing in according to seasonally adjusted data from the as a average production was by use it bears highlighting that durable consumer goods outperformed while other categories considering the industry twelve showed monthly in the quarter ended in the major changes were observed in printing and reproduction medical equipment and other transport equipment the main negative drivers were electronic and communication equipment capital goods for the electricity sector and basic metallurgy industrial production increased with special emphasis on the production of capital goods followed by the production of intermediate goods and and consumer goods while the production of durable consumer goods decreased on a trailing general industry grew in with highlights to the increases in the production of capital goods durable consumer goods and intermediate goods the nuci in the manufacturing calculated by reached in corresponding to a decrease and a increase according to the last comparison the increase in installed capacity utilization rate mainly reflects the one relative to capital which increased from to in november this the intermediate goods and construction material industries increased and while the consumer goods industry decreased by capital goods increased consumer goods and construction material were whereas intermediate goods decreased by vehicles production reached thousand units in according to data released by the anfavea and seasonally adjusted by representing a increase the sector production expanded in the year and in the last twelve months through vehicles sales increased in november and according to seasonally adjusted in the year and in the last twelve months through sales increased by and influenced both by the domestic market expansion and and by exports vehicles growth and following the same the lspa survey carried out by the ibge in october projected a annual decrease for grains in relative to representing million it bears highlighting in this corn and soybeans average which follow last are below historical record highs for these the total area projected increased to million and expectations according to the consumer expectations survey carried out by the fgv the consumer confidence index increased in seasonally reaching new historical record the result was influenced by the increase in the current situation index and in the expectation index the icc increased reflecting increases of in isa and of in the industry confidence index from fgv decreased in reaching considering seasonally adjusted a record low since november the index behavior with greater lower optimism regarding the coming the ie decreased and the isa declined the ici grew due to the increase in the isa and the decrease in the the services confidence index from fgv reduced in november after retreating by in the previous reflecting the fall of in the current situation index smoothed by the increase in the expectation index the ics grew and in the quarter ended in market according to the general record of employment and unemployment of the ministry of labor and employment thousand formal jobs were created in representing a increase considering seasonally adjusted in the year through thousand jobs were a high for the ten first months of the since the start of the in january according to the same comparison hiring registered a record in expansion in the services sector in manufacturing industry in commerce and in civil construction regarding the activity sectors mentioned formal employment increased and in it bears highlighting the hiring in the service sector and in commerce in the last twelve months through thousand formal jobs were created in the according to the ibge employment survey carried out in the six main metropolitan regions of the the unemployment rate declined for the fifth consecutive reaching in a historical record declining and in seasonally adjusted the unemployment rate also reached in declining as a result of increases of in the economically active population and in according to the same average real earnings usually earned by workers reached a record high for the increasing and in the year through contributing for the expansions of and in payroll according to the same comparison and delinquency rates outstanding credit in the financial system reached billion in equivalent to of increasing by in the in the year and in twelve credit operations increased by and according to the same comparison reflecting the increases of in the month and in the year and in twelve months for credit operations to individuals and and according to the same comparison for credit operations to earmarked credit operations increased in the in the year and in twelve with highlights for the rises of and recorded in housing credit and of and recorded in bndes according to the same comparison the average interest rate on credit operations increased in reaching the average annual rate on credit for individuals reached in increasing by relative to the average rate on corporate credit totaled in decreasing by relative to the average tenure on credit operations decreased in reaching down from days in this contraction mirrored the falls in the average tenure of credit for individuals and corporate days and which totaled days and following the same delinquency rates in the financial system loans used as reference for interest in arrears for more than ninety remained stable at in reducing in twelve a record low since january delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate and to individuals remained stable at and environment in the third economic activity accelerated in the us and in japan and cooled in the euro area and in regarding the us and gdp acceleration was positively influenced by the expansion in household although in japan this demand component has been benefited by governmental already extinct for the automotive but still in vigor until the end of the year for some certain durable in the the last beige book reported evidence of better performance of retail sales in several but it continues to signal a depressed housing real state in the same the interannual chinese gdp growth rate decelerated to down from in the previous regarding manufacturing the pmi index managers advanced in global manufacturing production in with highlights for the growth in the employment and new orders the assets prices in the financial and commodity markets shifted upwards and the upward among the resumption of liquidity ease in the was due to the improvement in consumption in several economies and to the effects of adverse weather conditions over supply the specific case of agricultural the downward movement reflected the surge of fears regarding the monetary tightening in china and the fiscal sustainability of some european whose uncertainties remain even after the agreement settled by the european union and the in this the us which had been depreciating in face of other started to appreciate in response to the growth of risk perception by financial less exposed to swings in food due to the composition of the consumption the consumer price indices of the mature economies maintained more stable behavior than those of the emerging the annual ipc change in in the in the euro in the uk and in the first positive change since february it bears highlighting that in the the annual ipc core change stood at a record low for the began in among the emerging also in the annual ipc increased in to in to in to and in to while it reduced in to in this the central banks in the euro uk and japan maintained the accommodative stance of their having the fed on november a new quantitative by deciding on the until the end of the second quarter of of more than billion in at a pace of billion per it bears highlighting since the last copom several central among which the ones from chile and have increased their basic interest trade and international reserves the brazilian trade surplus reached million in as a result of billion in exports and billion in as a the trade surplus accumulated in the year reached on a daily average the trade surplus fell by mirroring a growth in imports and a growth in total external trade grew by in the increasing to billion in the up from billion in international reserves reached billion in recording a million growth and a billion growth in the the monetary interventions accounted for net purchases of billion in the domestic in the accumulating billion in the first eleven months of market and open market operations since the october copom the futures interest rate yield curve shifted upwards for all mainly driven by the release of current inflation by the increase of inflationary expectations and by the uncertainties related to the conduction of fiscal policy by the next on the external the increase in the us treasuries rates also contributed to pressure the domestic interest from december this upward movement of the interest rate was partially due to the by the of macroprudential measures involving the increase of reserve requirements and increase of capital requirements for credit between october and december and rates increased by and the and threeyear rates increased by and real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed inflation increased from on october to on december in its open market the bcb carried between october and december repo operations borrowing billion for a as a the average daily balance of the long operations reached in the same the bcb also borrowed money through repo operations with tenures between and working increasing the average daily balance of borrowing operations to the bcb also borrowed money through overnight repo operations and conducted at the end of tenure liquidity management the very including the tenure liquidity management averaged a daily balance of billion in the the average daily balance of the total stock of repurchase agreements of the central bank decreased from billion between august and october to between october and december considering the daily balance of operations for the most recent there was a reduction in the daily balance of repurchase agreements totaling elevating the total stock from billion on october to billion on december the main drivers of liquidity retreat in the period were the net issuance of national treasury the net revenues of the union and the demand for currency by the between october and december the national treasury issuance regarding the traditional auctions raised a total of the sale of securities reached with billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion via maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of ntnbs reached for securities maturing in and update of economic outlook and baseline regarding the global the pandemic keeps causing a significant slowdown in global against this despite the additional provision of fiscal and monetary stimuli in major economies and some moderation in financial assets the environment for emerging economies remains turning to economic the data release showed the largest gdp decline since reflecting the initial effects of the recent indicators suggest that the economic activity contraction will be even uncertainty about the second economic recovery remains larger than several measures of underlying inflation are running below the levels compatible with meeting the inflation target at the relevant horizon for monetary inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and inflation tends to mainly reflecting the impacts of the reversal of international oil prices and of price adjustments of administered items that were in the hybrid scenario with interest rate path extracted from the focus survey and constant exchange rate at the copom projections stand around for and for this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at and rises to in in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for the scenario with constant interest rate at and constant exchange rate at yields inflation projections around for and for in this inflation projections for administered prices are for and for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the may copom meeting risks around the baseline inflation the baseline scenario for inflation encompasses risk factors in both on the one economic slack may continue to produce a prospective inflation this risk increases if a lengthening of the pandemic causes an increase in uncertainty and precautionary savings implies a decline in aggregate demand that is larger and longer than on the other fiscal policy responses to the pandemic that permanently aggravate the fiscal path or a frustration with the continuation of the reform agenda may increase the risk the credit and transfer programs implemented in response to the pandemic may cause a decline in aggregate introducing an asymmetry to the balance of this set of factors could potentially result in a path for inflation over the relevant horizon for monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary regarding the global the committee pondered that governments and central banks of major economies reacted in an unprecedentedly coordinated and strong thus partially mitigating the economic impacts of the unlike other the epicenter of the current crisis moved to all along with the better as well a larger pool of allows developed countries to fight against the pandemic in a more vigorous and efficient manner than emerging as a the sanitary and economic effects of the pandemic are larger in emerging especially in those with limited fiscal which reflects on risk aversion and capital flows toward these in this despite some moderation in the volatility of asset the international environment for the brazilian economy remains the copom members discussed the evolution of domestic economic activity in light of the available information and they evaluated that data for the second quarter corroborate the perspective of a sharp gdp contraction and suggest that economic activity reached the lowest level in registering only a partial recovery in may and the copom value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed in the five business days ended in the last day of the week prior to the copom central do copom scenario entails a sharp decline in gdp in the first half of this followed by a gradual recovery from the third quarter the copom members debated on the level of economic they reinforced their view that the pandemic shall exert a disinflationary impact on the brazilian together with a sharp increase in the level of economic the sudden growth in economic uncertainty should result in an increase in precautionary savings a significant reduction of aggregate the committee also considered the impact of the credit and transfer programs on aggregate the committee assessed that these programs have the potential to complement a significant portion of the aggregate demand that would be lost due to the effects of the as a the economic recovery could be faster than anticipated by the baseline the committee resumed the discussion on the potential effective lower limit for the brazilian interest most members of the committee believe that this limit would be significantly higher among emerging economies than among developed due to the existence of a risk this premium is dynamic and tends to be larger in given the relative fiscal fragility and the uncertainties regarding its prospective fiscal in this we would already be close to the level from which further interest rate reductions could be accompanied by asset price and potentially compromise the performance of some markets and economic the committee also reflected on the relative importance of the main components of the cost of credit and emphasized that liquidity premium seems to prevail at the the committee recognized that this set of as well as prudential justify caution in the conduct of monetary the copom judged that the disinflationary although accompanied by greater fiscal has triggered a downward revision on inflation expectations towards levels not compatible with the within the relevant horizon for monetary although this movement seems to have ceased in the expectations implicit in government it continues to occur in the expectations collected by the focus the committee keeps a close eye on revisions to the economic scenario and inflation and reaffirmed its commitment to the inflation target set by the national monetary which has always been and still is the main objective of monetary monetary policy taking into account the baseline the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to lower the selic rate by percentage point to the committee judges that this decision reflects its baseline scenario for prospective a variance in the balance of and it is consistent with convergence of inflation to its target over the relevant horizon for monetary which includes the committee believes that persevering in the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy is essential for a sustainable economic the copom also stresses that doubts regarding the continuation of the reform agenda and permanent changes to the fiscal consolidation process could result in an increase in the structural interest the copom believes that the current state of affairs continues to recommend an unusually strong monetary but it recognizes that the remaining space for monetary policy stimulus is uncertain and should be the committee believes that the fiscal trajectory over the next as well as the perception of its will be crucial to determine the length of the the magnitude of the monetary stimulus already implemented seems compatible with the economic impacts of the for the next the committee sees as appropriate to evaluate the impact of the pandemic and of the set of credit and transfer programs in place and foresees that any possible adjustment to the monetary stimulus would be the copom remains attentive to revisions of the economic scenario and of the inflation expectations for the relevant horizon of monetary the committee recognizes that the variance of its balance of risks has increased and that further information on the evolution of the as well as a decline in fiscal will be essential to determine its next the following members of the committee voted for this roberto oliveira campos neto bruno serra carolina de assis fernanda feitosa manoel pinho de costa de ribeiro and paulo neves de ipca inflation accelerated in april relative to in march and in as a inflation reached in the first four months of up from in the same period of trailing inflation continued to in after reaching in february and in it totaled in april in april under this comparison the acceleration of consumer price inflation essentially mirrors the behavior of market which increased more rapidly than regulated in market prices and regulated prices increased and in the twelve months through compared to and in the twelve months through april despite the brl the prices of tradable goods reaching to in april according to the same comparison regarding the prices of greatly pressured by the behavior in the prices of perishable food and trailing inflation was even higher evidencing the influence of domestic prices over preliminary data for may point to the continuity of inflation the recent behavior of ipca inflation has been remarkably less benign than that observed in previous so that since the end of inflation has signaled that it could be diverging from the targets reaching in the last six two out of the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb followed the inflation acceleration in the headline index in the core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation measures increased from and in march to and in on the other the trimmed means core inflation measure increased in unchanged relative to similarly to headline the three core inflation measures remarkably accelerated in the first four months of the compared to the same period of with increases from and to and for the core inflation by smoothed and trimmed means core on a trailing the three core inflation measures continued to accelerate following the behavior of headline core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices continued to increase to in up from in march and in smoothed trimmed means core inflation showed similar behavior in up from in while the trimmed means core inflation increased to in up from in and in it bears emphasizing that the behavior of diffusion indices suggests increased dissemination of inflation confirming the analysis present in previous copom the general price index inflation increased to in up from in march and in on a trailing inflation accelerated to in up from in march and in february to in april in the twelve months through the increase reflected both the behavior of the consumer price which totaled in april and also of the price whose variation totaled in april according to the same comparison the civil construction national index increased in april regarding agricultural inflation reached in the twelve months through april it bears highlighting the acceleration of industrial which began in the second half of and seems to have intensified in the first four months of the industrial ipa increased up from in the same period of in the last twelve wholesale industrial price inflation increased to in up from in december as mentioned in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will depend on current and prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation on a moving average according to data seasonally adjusted by the industrial output increased in after growing by in the previous still considering the seasonally adjusted after the expansion observed in industrial output increased in it bears noticing that general industrial output grew in the with respective increases of and in manufacturing and in mining in a industrial output showed remarkable volatility in march and with changes of and mainly driven by the unusual number of working days recently the data already released for the last months in to the continuity of the industrial production expansion despite at a pace dependent of possible limits to supply among the use according to data seasonally adjusted by the capital goods production increased significantly in april up from in the other use categories showed declines at the totaling for intermediate for durable consumer goods and for and consumer among industrial production capital goods production leads the with a followed by the elevation in durable consumer goods the scenario of solid expansion of capital goods production observed since mainly driven by the consolidation of positive prospects for the continuity of economic underpinned by the perception of macroeconomic stability seems to persist in this on its the dynamism of durable consumer goods production the remarkable improvement in credit when compared to historical it should be highlighted that the emergency of signs pointing to pressure over the availability of production as suggested in some industrial indicates that accommodation in the pace of industrial activity expansion could be greatly associated to productive capacity labor market continues to present quite favorable the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the monthly labor survey decreased to in down from in march and in as a the average unemployment rate in the first four months of the year was below that observed in the same period of according to data seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate decreased to in a record low for the month since the start of the historical series in down from in march and in in average real earnings fell and increased on the other in average real earnings increased and as a real payrolls expanded by in up from in the previous and in continuing to constitute a key driver for sustained aggregate demand according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment reduced by in april in in employment grew totaling growth in the last twelve still regarding data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate the continuity of strong expansion in formal employment this with the creation of thousand jobs in april from thousand in march and thousand in in the first four months of the employment reached a record high of thousand formal employment grew by in seasonally observed data point to a expansion in formal employment in the last twelve an evidence of strong dynamism in the labor the services sector presented the highest hiring rate in with the creation of thousand new followed by the manufacturing industry and by civil construction a record high for the the retail sector recorded thousand new the agricultural sector created thousand new due to the activities related to sugar cane plantations in the in line with the positive developments in the labor market and with the credit retail sales continue to record positive indicating that the pace of domestic demand growth remains and signs of cooling cannot be according to data seasonally adjusted by the expanded retail sales grew by in up from the in growing as a consequence of the march expanded retail sales growth averaged in the first quarter of the according to data seasonally it should be highlighted the expansion in the sales of clothing and shoes and supermarket food beverages and tobacco despite the rise of food and fuels and lubricants in accumulated growth was more significant in computing and communication material and personal and domestic and parts and the steady growth of retail sales has reflected the performance of both the sectors more sensitive to income and employment expansions and those more sensitive to credit for the next the continuity of the current cycle of retail sales expansion is and will continue to be underpinned by employment and income credit expansion and the maintenance of consumer confidence at high sector for relative to automobile sales in april and corroborate this the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing industry reached in up from the observed in according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the a record high for the according to data seasonally adjusted by the nuci in the manufacturing industry reached down from the record high observed in without the seasonal the nuci in april stood above the level registered in the same month of as a the average rate of the first quarter of was above the level observed in the same period of the quarterly nuci calculated by fundação getulio vargas reached in according to the seasonally adjusted above the level in for the consumer goods and capital goods the utilization rates in april reached and in both cases a record high for the the maintenance of high installed capacity utilization with some reduction of idle capacity at the occurs in several sectors despite the significant increase in in april according to seasonally adjusted the absorption of capital goods firmly increased due to the vigorous growth of capital goods imports in and capital goods production the production of civil construction inputs decreased in the same after a increase in recent data indicate although investment has been contributing to soften the increasing trend of capacity utilization it has not been sufficient to contain this in this the timely maturation of investment projects will be crucial to limit mismatches regarding the evolution of aggregate supply and domestic demand in the relevant forecast period for monetary as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and to adequately meet demand the trade balance continues to present deceleration at the which was already and is in line with assessments present in inflation reports and previous copom in the last twelve months through may the trade surplus reached billion below may exports and imports totaled billion and equivalent to and in the last twelve in comparison to the same period ended in may as highlighted in previous copom imports have been growing faster than both due to the strengthening of the brl and to the robust economic activity in the notwithstanding the increases in the prices of several commodities included in the brazilian export the decrease in trade surplus contributed to the billion current account deficit registered in the twelve months through april equivalent to of foreign direct investment reached billion in the same equivalent to of regarding the external the us economy seems to have entered a process of economic stagnation since the last quarter of and still suffers the impact of the crisis in the real estate with spillover effects on the labor whose in combination with higher oil affects consumer contributing importantly to depress even if the influence of monetary and fiscal stimulus can reduce the risk of a significant contraction in the dominant scenario seems to point to a more consistent recover only from even after significant strengthening of capital basis of relevant financial uncertainties still remain about the length and amplitude of the effects of the us subprime mortgages market crisis over us and european banking system and over credit conditions for households and uncertainties persist about the capability of monetary and fiscal policy measures implemented by the us authorities to smooth the weakening of the us economy in a timely in light of the ongoing difficulties of the financial despite the reduction of systemic risk since such difficulties could be worsened by a cyclic deterioration in the quality of which would reinforce the already evident trend to financial increasing the risk of slowdown prospects for economic activity in europe and in spite of some favorable indicators in have also despite not provoking the same degree of concerns that surround the us economic it should be highlighted that despite the prospects of continuity of slowdown for mature global inflationary pressures have this has partially reflected strong economic growth in many emerging which so far have been apparently little affected by the us mortgage offsetting the effects of economic deceleration in mature in in light of pressures over production factors which have triggered inflationary pressures in many emerging the trend seems to point to the continuity of monetary tightening for mature prospects for monetary policy are more notwithstanding the fact that inflation which in some cases starts to deteriorate inflation seems to limit the scope for additional monetary policy even if the risks to activity stemming from the credit crisis in this volatility and risk aversion indicators in international financial markets have remained at quite high levels since the last copom although showing some contraction at the the elevation of brazilian sovereign risk assessment by major rating agencies tends to reduce the sensitivity that brazilian assets prices show relative to the international contributing to but not to the effects of difficulties experienced by the global economy over brazilian economic essentially driven by domestic oil systematic source of uncertainty stemming from the international once more increased substantially since the last copom meeting and continue highly this behavior reflects structural changes in energy which have blocked the recovery of inventory levels traditionally in addition to recurrent geopolitical despite significant uncertainties inherent to oil prices the main scenario considered by the copom forecasts unchanged domestic gasoline prices in despite the probability of materialization of an alternative scenario is apart from the behavior of domestic gasoline one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts domestic economy both through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of inflation the prices of other especially which have also increased significantly since the last copom despite more pessimism about the prospects for global economic growth and the turmoil on global financial showed heterogeneous performance in the last but with few to record significant increases in the assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the assumptions considered in the april copom projected adjustments for gasoline and bottled gas prices once adjusted according to the effects stemming from specific and so were maintained at for compared to the assumptions considered in the april copom the projections for fixed telephone prices were maintained at in while the projections for electricity price adjustments were changed to up from the projection for regulated prices based on individual was maintained at for this set of according to data released by the corresponded to of the total april the projection for regulated prices inflation in was maintained at this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic rate based on the swap rates estimates a spread in the fourth quarter of and spread in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and increased by the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the april copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group increased significantly to up from ahead inflation expectations increased as well from to considering the composition of median monthly inflation market for inflation expectations increased to up from considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased compared to the value considered at the april copom remaining above the target established by the national monetary council for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the value considered at the last copom and is also above the central target for the the projection for based on the benchmark scenario increased relative to the april copom whilst the projection based on the market scenario remained stable in both projections are above the monetary policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute for the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the intensity of domestic demand expansion continues quite showing acceleration in some segments and regions in the first quarter of and is at least for the inflationary pressures observed in the despite strong imports growth and the benign investment even in the context of moderate deceleration of global growth this year and the higher volatility observed in global markets since the committee according to information available at the that the balance of payments should not represent imminent risk to the inflationary evaluation corroborated by the recent upgrade to investment grade of brazilian sovereign debt on the other there are signs that relevant inflationary pressures are intensifying both in mature and emerging evidencing the existence of inflationary risks on the global the copom reaffirms the stated in previous that an alternative scenario of more intense and generalized global deceleration represents an ambiguous risk factor for the brazilian on the one by reducing net exports it would act as a factor to restrain aggregate the potential decrease of some important commodities prices could contribute to a lower domestic on the other the alternative scenario could unfavorably impact inflation prospects through two in the case of deceleration in the mature economies that comprise the global financial markets risk aversion could resulting in decreased demand for brazilian assets and depreciation of their in in the medium a possible reduction of net exports could similarly affect the price sustainability of certain brazilian in light of the deterioration of inflation in a more uncertain the committee evaluates that the risk of materialization of a less benign inflationary scenario continues to be the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last monetary policy should act so that impacts initially focused on price partially derived from relative prices adjustments that occur in global do not result in persistent deterioration of inflation dynamics through the worsening in the copom understands that the maintenance of monetary stability is a necessary condition so that the relative prices system continues to signal efficiently the adjustments requested for ongoing consumption and production patterns in the the copom considers that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory remain because the heated domestic demand and market of in addition to the possibility of emergency of supply restrictions in some can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the committee understands that the prospects for this as well as for the generalization of the local pressures initially focused on consumer price depend in a critical manner on inflation which increased significantly in the recent and continue to be carefully it is worth noticing that although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable heated domestic demand can trigger intense inflationary pressures in the nontradable for such as in the services in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will continue to carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as inflation expectations within the forecast promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance in order to avoid the consolidation of a scenario where adjustments become persistent or generalized price the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consequent consolidation of a longlasting stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the continuous progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception that has occurred in the last the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious and timely monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets even in light of global inflationary for this to it is important that inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and converge throughout relevant period for the monetary the committee once that there are important time lags between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects over economic activity and the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit despite more moderate due to an increase in funding and real payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic the effects of governmental transfers expected for this and the next quarters should also add up to the factors that will sustain but with less intensity than previously these considerations become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate the dissemination of pressures resulting from adjustments in relative and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have concentrated effects in the second half of and in the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive this together with the external has helped to mitigate inflationary the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by income and credit continues to present significant risks to inflationary in this the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and the increase of demand continue to be vital to the assessment of different possibilities of monetary policy aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the time lags in the transmission mechanisms and has proved to be the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and that is the reason why variables such as inflation the balance of risks associated to the scenario the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so at the current characterized by the deterioration in current and expected inflationary prudence assumes an even more important role in this in the current there is the risk is that economic agents start to attribute higher probability that inflation increases will become which would reduce the efficacy of the monetary the backed by international is that the performance of monetary policy tends to be more when the deterioration of inflationary dynamics is in its early rather than when it is the committee believes that the present monetary policy which will be kept while it is will assure the convergence of inflation towards the targets if the risk profile deteriorates in a matter that implies shifts in the basic inflation prospective scenario considered at the present the committee will promptly adjust the monetary policy stance to the the copom evaluates in light of signals of economy as illustrated by the acceleration of some wholesale prices and the evolution of core inflation and by the fast increase in inflation the risks for the concretization of a benign inflationary in which ipca would remain in line with the targets are in the deterioration of the scenario is already present in the inflation the copom also considers that the persistence of significant mismatch between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand tends to increase the risk for the inflationary in these monetary policy should act through the adjustment of the basic interest rate in order on the one contribute to the convergence between the paces of expansion of aggregate supply and demand on the other avoid that inflationary pressures initially focused on price indices lead to persistent deterioration of expectations and of the inflation by acting as the balance of risks to inflation dynamics so the committee understands that it in contributing to sustain economic which requires predictability and consequent extension of the planning horizon for businesses and as well as to protect the substantial increases in real income of workers observed in recent the copom ratifies that the decisions of monetary policy necessarily take into consideration the time lags of the transmission and that they are part of a dynamic whose results will become evident throughout in this continuing the process of adjustment of the basic interest rate initiated in the the committee unanimously decided to raise the selic target rate to without under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine the prospective price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to its domestic demand continues to expand backingup economic activity including sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive factors are still on its the contribution of the external sector to a benign in light of robust domestic demand growth and the increase of global inflationary seems to become less at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority should act in order to avoid that uncertainties contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on july for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september summary of data analyzed by the copom inflation inflation increased in down from in food and beverages prices increased contributing to the monthly index unchanged relative to showing the resilience of the price increases in this the second main driver of the in contributing came from the increase in personal which accelerated relative to april market prices increased in up from in the previous with price elevations in tradable goods and goods regulated prices increased down from in the diffusion index reached in the highest level since january with a average in up from in the same period of in the last twelve months through increased against in due to elevations of in market prices and in regulated the core inflation measures accelerated both on and trailing the core excluding household food and regulated prices increased in up from in totaling in twelve months highest rate since april up from in the trimmed means core evolved from in april to in accumulating in the last twelve also the highest rate since april the smoothed trimmed means core increased in up from in totaling in the last twelve months highest rate observed since january against in inflation increased in up from in accumulating in the last twelve among the index only the decelerated against in reaching in twelve inflation increased up from in totaling in twelve incc inflation increased in up from in reaching in the last twelve the lower change in may reflected inflation deceleration in five out of seven groups that compose the with highlights for the cooling in housing which changed in the down from in the change in food prices in may remained the highest for the index although barely the same as the rate of the previous month and according the same trend captured by the higher increase in the inflation rate in may reflected the behavior of both agricultural and industrial agricultural prices increased in reversing the decrease in totaling in the last twelve the industrial ipa increased up from in accumulating in twelve the ipa also accelerated in may considering all processing mainly in the prices of gross raw which increased after decreasing in the prices of final goods increased up from in while the prices of intermediate goods increased up from in the same activity according to seasonally adjusted data from the monthly survey retail sales increased in considering the expanded retail sales which includes construction material and vehicles and parts and it bears emphasizing the increases of in the sales of and and in and food beverages and while the sales of computing and communication material and equipment decreased under the same the volume of sales in the commerce increased in the first quarter of recording a generalized growth in all with emphasis to computing and communication material and other personal and domestic parts and furniture and home and clothing and the results of retail sales evidenced the increase of favorable credit impacts of income transfer and higher agricultural according to são paulo trade association related to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the database consultations for credit sales increased in april while the consultations to the usecheque system decreased compared to april there were respective increases of and regarding investment domestic production of capital goods increased in seasonally while the production of construction inputs decreased compared to april these indicators increased and still according to this comparison the positive evolution of capital goods production reflects mainly the expansion of agricultural equipment and transportation equipment capital goods imports increased in according to fundação centro de estudos do comércio exterior seasonally adjusted by the confirming the expansionist trajectory of investments in brazilian capital goods imports increased cni seasonally adjusted by the showed expansion of industrial activity in with increases of in industrial real revenues and in hours worked in compared to april and the first four months of industrial real revenues increased and and hours worked in and in the same installed capacity utilization reached in a record high for the series and above the march considering seasonally adjusted and above the april according to the observed according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in april while the moving average remained almost stable sixteen out of the activities surveyed recorded production increase in april by use only the production of capital goods increased the production of intermediate goods showed relative stability while the production of and consumer goods declined after a increase in the previous durable goods production decreased after three consecutive increases a industrial activity increased with expansion in all use highlighting the increases of in capital goods production and in durable consumer goods in the first four months of compared to the same period of these rates reached and in the same the production of intermediate goods and and consumer goods expanded by and on a trailing industrial output expanded in up from in showing acceleration at the in contrast to and the moving average seasonally adjusted data vehicles production reached thousand units in according to increasing considering seasonally adjusted the production of vehicles increased with expansions in the production of automobiles buses and trucks considering seasonally adjusted and the same comparison the production of agricultural machinery increased by in the first four months of the the production of vehicles and agricultural machinery increased and compared to the same period of in the same total vehicles sales increased with expansion of in domestic sales and decrease of in according to the survey carried out by the ibge in planted area was estimated at about million a increase relative to april the grains harvest should reach million tons in increasing this result encompasses increases of and in corn and soybean which are responsible for of total grains production and occupy of total planted the survey also estimated an increase in sugar cane with an expansion in planted and a increase in coffee an effect of the biannual cyclic recovery in and expectations the survey showed a decrease in the consumer confidence index in reflecting the and retractions in current economic conditions index and in consumer expectations index the icc grew by due to expansions of and in the icea and according to the fgv the icc grew in this result reflected a increase in the current situations index and a elevation in the expectations index which computes ahead the survey registered increases of and in the isa and still according to the the industry confidence index reached points in up from in the indicator stayed above the level registered in the same month of reflecting the elevations of in the isa and in the according to the fgv manufacturing industry installed capacity utilization reached in standing above the april level and the nuci decreased in intermediate goods and increased and in construction consumer and capital goods market according to the ministry of labor and thousand new formal jobs were created in april totaling thousand in the first four months of the employment level increased by in seasonally adjusted expanding in all with highlights to the expansion in the construction sector and the creation of thousand new jobs in the services according to the ibge employment survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate reached of economically active population in compared to in the previous month and in april the stability of the unemployment rate between march and april reflected the increase of thousand employed compared to thousand who entered the labor occupation increased while the pea increased formal workers in the private sector increased between april and representing thousand and the number of and informal workers decreased and respectively thousand and thousand compared to april formal workers in the private sector leaded the occupation growth the number of selfemployed workers increased and the number of informal workers decreased the same survey showed that average real earnings of occupied workers grew in april and real payrolls increased in april in the and according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the employment in manufacturing industry and real payroll increased and in in the first four months of employment and real payroll in the manufacturing industry increased by and compared to the same period of and delinquency rates credit operations in the financial system expanded by in expanding by on a twelvemonth trailing according to the same comparison credit operations increased and while earmarked credit operations elevated and among the leasing operations remained with expansions of and for credit to

same month of delinquency rates for credit operations with corporate and individuals reached and compared to and in april net delinquency rate for retail measured by the reached in up from according to the seasonal adjusted net delinquency rate stood at in up from external environment there are evidences that the financial market turmoil and the worst of the liquidity crises have already although still the risks to the global economic outlook stemming from the real estate markets in the signals of deterioration in the commercial real estate mortgage market arose and tend to sharpen due to the less favorable conjuncture and the financial institution conservatism in credit in european countries such as ireland and the united there are signals of saturation of their mortgage with a downward mirroring the adverse effects of the crisis in credit and the weakening of the prices of real estate in the uk recorded the sharpest monthly fall in the inflationary outlook more inflation expectations continues to despite the deceleration observed in great part of global inflation index reached a record high for the last nine this fact can be perceived because the reduction of the purchase power is still not effective and also because inflation has been pressured mostly by more inelastic consumer the inflationary process remains resilient to keeping the central banks under strict oil prices have reached record highs and the cycle of commodities prices rises in the international market continues to pressure domestic inflation in several several factors explain the cycle of commodities prices such as the new development standard reached by emerging prices transmissions among different commodities and inventories at historically low foreign trade and international reserves in may brazilian trade surplus reached totaling surpluses of billion in the year and billion in the last twelve in the year trough exports reached and growing by and compared to the same period of in exports totaled reaching a million daily a growth imports totaled billion in with a million daily a increase imports and exports reached record highs for both impacted by the regularization of the exports which had been harmed by the strike of the brazilian state tax agency auditors between march and may international reserves totaled billion in with increases of million in the month and compared to the end of money market and open market operations in the period between the april and the may copom the yield curve shifted upwards in all and sharpened in its intermediate this move was mainly driven by the release of inflation indicators and by the increase of inflation the future interest rates recorded momentary relief twice after the grant of investment grade level to brazilian sovereign debt by two risk on april and may between april and june and rates went up by bps and both and rates increased by and the threeyear by real interest measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation increased to on june up from on april on april and may the bcb carried out reverse fx swap auctions amounting billion and with the rollover of the may and june in its open market the bcb carried from april to june weekly and fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations reached of which billion were in the same the bcb conducted overnight repoborrowing the bcb also conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to two working operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged in on april the bcb conducted borrowing operations with tenures of and working and on may operations with tenures of working amounting and these operations totaled billion on a daily average between april and june the national treasury raised a total of of which billion in billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and issuance of lfts totaled for securities maturing in and issuance of reached for securities maturing in and in the same the treasury conducted auctions to sell ltns maturing in april and july and bought ltns maturing in july totaling issuance of for securities maturing in and settled in other national treasury totaled the treasury also conducted sales auctions of lfts maturing in and which totaled receiving lfts maturing in as and purchase auctions to buy ltns and totaling billion and monthly inflation measured by the extended consumer price index reached in percentage points above the one recorded in the previous as a inflation accumulated in months reached in september in september with market prices increasing by in september and regulated in september specifically regarding market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months through september in september and the prices of in september it bears noticing that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in twelve months through september in september and the prices of services rose in september in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services sector in the short the realignment process of regulated prices and temporary supply shocks in the food and beverages the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in august to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in september the double weight core inflation changed from in august to in the core by which excludes ten household food items and changed from to and the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from to the trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to and the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation from to the diffusion index stood at in september above the one recorded in september the general price index increased in reaching on a trailing basis in september the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in september with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through september in september the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in september partially driven by pressures stemming from labor which changed in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in august the decreased and seasonally the composite purchasing index regarding brazil changed from in august to in indicating strong the industry confidence index and the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation decreased and between august and on its the services confidence index decreased reaching a new historical regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the in an increase of in the grains production in relative to the the industrial activity decreased in according to the seasonally adjusted series released by the the industrial production accumulates a change of in the last twelve months through according to the observed the industrial production decreased in with negative results in the four use categories and in out of the surveyed according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry increased between july and according to the seasonally adjusted and it stands lower than the one registered in august the pmi of the industrial on its changed from in august to in among the use comparing august and july according to seasonally adjusted data capital goods and durable consumer goods presented the sharpest the semi and goods production also decreased in august on its the intermediate goods production presented the only positive result in this month regarding there was a decrease in the production of the four capital goods durable consumer goods semi and consumer goods and intermediate goods according to the continuous national household sample survey the unemployment rate in the moving quarter ended in july was estimated at an increase of compared to the same period last according to the monthly employment survey covering six metropolitan the unemployment rate stood at in increasing and data released by the ministry of labor and employment showed reduction of thousand formal jobs in while thousand formal jobs were destroyed in the in the set of available data confirm a process of distension in the labor according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume decreased in on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction decreased in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted with retraction in eight of the ten in twelve the retail sales growth rate fell by and the broad retail sales decreased the trade confidence index measured by the decreased between august and after the fifth consecutive the index reached the lowest level for the historical series started in march the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in september according to the seasonally adjusted among the industry use according to the seasonally adjusted the ones showing the highest nuci are intermediate goods and construction material followed by consumer goods durable consumer goods and capital goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through according to the ministry of industry and foreign trade the trailing trade balance surplus reached billion in september this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with retreats of and relative to the cumulative results through september on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in august equivalent to of the foreign direct investment to the direct investment liabilities totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators in the horizon relevant for monetary growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging for most advanced the signs are of moderate particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements restraining investments and in the united the view of sustainability of the economic recovery in the emerging the activity pace has been revised with highlight for the loss of strenght in regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging despite the ongoing advances in the debate on the normalization of monetary the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced in the emerging they stand at relatively high the price of the brent oil barrel has remained around since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural commodities have risen while metal commodities prices have fallen on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through september of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the september copom among other this projection considers the hypothesis of changes of in the price of of in the price of bottled gas and of in electricity the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for higher than the valued considered at the september committee the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at of the gdp for and of the gdp for it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario considers the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the inflation projection compared to the value considered at the previous copom both for and for and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the inflation projections for and also increased relative to the value considered at the september and remain above the inflation policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the committee considers that the external environment remains with episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial for the the trend for global activity shows more moderation throughout the monetary policy relevant the prospects continue to indicate activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition period of more moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights evidence of new sources of volatility in the currency and fixed income as well as moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and gdp growth rates have continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the this process is being intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of in investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of these and private consumption also shows contraction in line with recent data regarding employment and for the after a necessary period of which has been more intense and may be longer than the the activity expansion pace tends to as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain these coupled with other ones currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economic regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of agriculture and livestock have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the speed of materialization of these changes and of the gains resulting from them depends fundamentally on a path of primary surpluses that strengthens the perception of the public sector balance in addition to reducing uncertainties surrounding the domestic the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint even if more slowly and with lower intensity than previously the committee notes that the lack of the significant changes in the trajectory of primary as well as in its impact the working hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a negative perception regarding of the macroeconomic regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong consumer credit has so over the last there on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by actions that were the committee considers as opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit in the as anticipated by previous the copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market has increased at a faster with data confirming the acceleration in the process of distension in this a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of increases incompatible with productivity with negative impacts over in spite of the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimates for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers over these relative prices ajustments in the among other have the balance of risks to inflation in this as anticipated in previous these price adjustments cause inflation to rise in the short term and to tend to remain high in requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts over the committee reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the second order effects stemming from given the assessing the macroeconomic the inflation prospects and the current balance of the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the committee understands that the maintainence of this basic interest rate at this for a sufficiently long is necessary for the convergence of inflation to the target in the relevant horizon for the monetary the copom emphasizes that monetary policy will remain vigilant to achieve this the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz edson otávio ribeiro sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its the net exports show better either by increasing benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and the depreciation of the or by the ongoing import substitution for the the combined effects of these the developments in the fiscal and quasi fiscal framework and in the assets this the dynamics of the regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by in the relevant horizon for the monetary the committee emphasizes that there are uncertainties associated with the balance of mainly on the speed of the recovery process of fiscal results and its and that the relative price realignment process has been slower and more intense than the previously in this the committee understands regardless of the outline of the other the monetary policy must remain in order to ensure the compliance with the inflation targeting regime objectives and the convergence of inflation to the target of on the relevant at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on november for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june after recording in monthly inflation measured by ipca reached in as a trailing inflation reached in march in february and in above inflation registered in the twelve months through march the inflation increase in this period the behavior of market which increased while regulated prices increased in the same period of regarding market it bears highlighting that tradable goods inflation reached and goods increased services price inflation continues at high levels in the period through march it reached the highest since august in the set of available information suggests that prices acceleration observed in process led by market show some in part because services inflation remains at high in the first three months of the ipca increased above inflation observed in the same period of the main contributors were transport and personal that increased and compared to and in the these items were responsible for of the period headline food and beverage was below that observed for the group in the the food price continues to play a relevant role in the headline inflation recent in the twelve months ended in food and beverage prices continue to record high accumulating in the recent elevation in food prices has shown persistence and in supply domestic and heightened by the high liquidity environment in international financial markets and by global demand each of the three main underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb performed similarly to the headline while there was an increase in the accumulated inflation until monthly rates retreated between january and the smoothed trimmed means core inflation reduced from in january to in and in the double weight core after registering in kept unchanged in in february and while the core inflation by exclusion accelerated from in january to in and retreated to in in the period until the three core measures registered and compared to and in and and in the ipca diffusion which had reached in retreated to in but increased in march and continues to show a spreading price the general price index inflation in the in registering compared to in in the period through march it accumulated above the registered in the same period through march inflation measured by its main the wholesale price index reached in twelve reflecting an increase of in the industrial ipa and in the agricultural in the breakdown according to the production raw material prices accumulated intermediate goods and final goods in the same inflation measured by the consumer price index another component of the recorded in the twelve months through march above the recorded until march according to the same comparison the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased the new producer price calculated by that measures the industry price level excluding freights and registered increase in compared to in in twelve this index decreased to in from in as emphasized in previous copom the copom evaluates that the effects of wholesale prices over consumer price inflation will among other on the current and prospective demand the exposure of each sector to external and domestic as well as on the price expectations for the future inflation regarding the gdp of the it grew by year over year and quarter over the gdp growth in at market was the highest since being impacted by the low comparison from the aggregated demand household consumption expanded government consumption and gross fixed capital formation in it is noteworthy that investment rate reached in higher than in still compared to domestic demand strongly contributed to the product surpassing the negative contribution of the external sector from the aggregated supply industry grew in the while agribusiness and services grew and the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on production it constitutes an important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the grew in after increasing in january and being relatively stable in december considering the growth of a threemonth period over the previous three was the increase in the period dec a moderate growth rate trend persists in the accumulated in twelve reducing from in january to in towards sustainable the services confidence index from in the in after increasing in february and retreating in the average index in the first quarter was below the average index in industrial activity is relatively at high in spite of the increase in the industrial output in february month with more working days in according to data seasonally adjusted by the after increasing in january and reducing in the moving average growth rate reached in the period dec feb after reducing in period through jan output increased in in the last twelve output increased in down from in continuing the process of growth compared to december month with the lowest output level during the the growth until february was the recovery dynamics was partially supported by the growth of industrial activity financing by public financial among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the durable consumer goods production reduced in while and consumer goods retreated in the same capital goods production increased while intermediate goods production increased in twelve months through february durable consumer goods production grew and consumer and intermediate capital goods industry activity growth is the highest among use with a increase in the twelve months period through evidencing the investment a relevant factor for economic recovery in the the unemployment rate in the six metropolitan regions covered by the ibge monthly labor survey according to observed increased from in february to in march below the level registered in march after reaching in march the observed data not only significantly reduced until march but reached a record low for the month since the start of the series in march the seasonally adjusted rate registered in a decrease compared to measured by the number of employed workers in the metropolitan increased in february and in march data from the ministry of labor and employment indicate growth in formal employment in eleven out of the twelve last in thousand jobs were created thousand in march while in february thousand jobs were created thousand in february services was the sector that mostly contributed for the formal employment increase in according to real average earnings observed in march increased and as a real considering real average earnings in the six metropolitan expanded in continuing to constitute a key driver for the maintenance of domestic demand according to the retail monthly survey from the expanded retail sales have been increasing since may growth was in in january and in according to the seasonally adjusted expanded retail sales showed stability in after reducing in january and increasing in average sales in the quarter ended in february reduced to it also bears noticing that accumulated growth rate reached in and all ten sectors surveyed performed positively in with by for vehicles and parts and pieces and furniture and appliances in the next the retail trajectory will continue to be benefited by governmental real payroll consumer confidence and an even more moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by without seasonal changed from in february to in these values are close to the observed in the same period of according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the nuci reduced from in february to in at the consumer goods and construction inputs categories showed the same reduction in nuci while capital and intermediate goods categories were according to the confederation of national industry data seasonally adjusted by the the nuci in december reached in up from in in installed capacity utilization rates have shown relative at high the high occupation level reflects the recent expansion in economic whose effects have not been totally offset by the maturity of investment in this the absorption of capital goods grew in while construction inputs production increased as stressed in previous copom the inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments related to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand the trade balance result in the last twelve months increased from billion in february to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and compared to the period ended in march current account deficit accumulated in twelve months changed from billion in january to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of exceeding the need for external the global economy recovery follows different speeds and asymmetrical inflation there are of activity moderation at the due to the developments in to the labor market uncertainties in the and to oil international price in the indicator released by the organization for economic and development for signaled world recovery continuity in but with a certain moderation in emerging the purchasing managers index for the global that shows the industry and service sector activity reduced in march to the lowest level in the last six after in the highest level since in the disaggregated pmi indicators evidence lower dynamism in the without affecting the positive moderate growth in the main emerging and negative effect of the recent geological events on the japanese the macroeconomic prospects for the euro zone continue to be doubts about solvency of some peripheral economies at the same time that the germany expansion continues at a strong it bears highlighting that important decisions regarding permanent mechanisms to support troubled economies in the euro zone were postponed to june this regarding monetary the european central bank increased the basic while the other central in particular the kept theirs inflation rate cores are still at moderate levels in the group euro zone and in the emerging there are inflationary pressures in asia and in eastern with highlights to russia and in this since the last copom meeting monetary conditions were tightened in several emerging in the bank of china announced the fourth since december in the referential interest rates for deposits and as well as the seventh increase in reserve brent oil prices have increased since the last copom surpassing the although it shows some accommodation at the this price acceleration is consistent with a framework of apparent strengthening in the global demand empiric evidence suggests that international oil in the last two have been more intensely influenced by global demand conditions than by the supply side as well as of political instability in some countries of the middle east in north it bears highlighting that geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten price which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment the main scenario adopted by the copom assumes increase in gasoline prices in regarding the other it is noteworthy the moderation of agricultural and metallic commodities after months of expressive in the uncertainties that emerged from the tragic events occurred in japan determined reassessments of the global demand for iron ore and of the risk of production discontinuity in important supply the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers reduced in march after increasing for eight consecutive this movement was leveraged among other the reduction in international prices of cereals and vegetable oils that are still in high levels when compared to the previous in recent the high volatility in commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations of demand growth and to fx markets the volatility and risk aversion indicators in the international financial markets increased considerably as a consequence of the events in but reduced since in this it highlights the improvement of the brazilian sovereign risk by credit rating as well as the worsening of the us sovereign rating of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustments for accumulated for grew to due to the increases occurred this in opposition to considered in the march copom and the adjustments for bottled gas for the same were kept unchanged at the projected adjustments for fixed telephone and electricity rates in were kept at and the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on individual according to the benchmark was increased to against considered in the march this set of according to data released by the accounted for of the total march the projection for regulated prices inflation in according to the benchmark was increased to up from considered in the march such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement of the public sector primary surplus target of billion of without in to parameters contained in the budget guidelines law a primary surplus of is considered for according to budget guidelines law project including the effect of the minimum wage increase projected for the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reserve requirements changes announced in december since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations moved from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the medians for the ipca reached and while for they reached and the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relatively to the figure considered at the march copom and it stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin at the period immediately prior to the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands above the inflation midpoint for the projection increased in both and stands above the midpoint in an alternative that considers the maintenance of the exchange during the forecast at the recent past and the interest trend collect by the projected inflation is above the target in and around this value in policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic mainly price it is additionally noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reinforce the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and as a consequence of the stabilization and correction of which determined important structural the process of maturing of the inflation targets regime stands at an advanced and it reflects favorably in the dynamics of neutral interest rate and in the power of monetary evidences under this respect can be among other through the accomplishment of inflation targets in the last seven at the same time that real interest rates have progress in the financial markets the fx and the inflationary risk premiums among other seem to have determined significant reduction in the neutral the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public ratio also contributed for from another some of these combined to such as the extension of contract also suggest that the power of monetary policy in brazil has been increasing in the last despite the substantial uncertainty that surrounds the calculation of the committee also considers that there are evidences that the traction of monetary policy increased in the recent past compared to what was observed some years currently inflationary pressures are contained with more efficiency by monetary policy in international volatility and risk aversion have increased since the last copom mostly fueled by the extraordinary levels of global liquidity and adverse geopolitical in this remained high concerns about european sovereign and banking debts and the possible deceleration in prices of important commodities mainly agricultural at the same the us currency in the perspectives for brazilian economy external financing remain in other the price indexes path shows clear dissemination of inflation pressures in the main the copom evaluates although moderation of domestic demand growth is yet in uncertain prospects for economic activity are relatively this assessment is supported by signs despite showing some point to the fact that the expansion of credit supply tends to both for individuals and and by the fact that consumers and businessmen confidences stand at historically high notwithstanding some accommodation in the among other the copom that the dynamism of domestic activity will continue to be benefited by the vigor of labor mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and substantial growth of real the copom evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario has not developed favorably since the last in the last quarter of and in the first quarter of inflation was strongly and negatively impacted domestic and external supply evidences suggest that consumer prices have already incorporated substantial part of these also relevant were the localized effects of the atypical concentration of regulated prices adjustments in the first quarter of the for the year as a the behavior of these items tends to be relatively the committee considers that these effects should still impact consumer prices among other through at the same it as risks derived from the persistence of the mismatch between supply and demand growth despite the signs that this mismatch tends to it highlights the narrow idleness margin of the production especially labor and analyzes in such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of nominal wages increases incompatible with productivity gains and its negative impact on the inflation it is also noteworthy to mention the risks associated to commodities prices trajectory in international despite recent signs of have been presenting surrounded by great the copom considers two distinct moments for inflation according to the main in this quarter and in the inflation accumulated in twelve months tends to remain at levels similar or even above the observed in the first in great is explained by the high inertia that stemmed from by the shocks duration that hit the economy at the end of last that extended to the first quarter of this and by the fact that the in contrast with what was observed in point to inflation rates close to the historical standard in the quarter from the fourth quarter the main scenario indicates a downward trend for the inflation accumulated in twelve moving to the target the copom reaffirms that the inflation main scenario considers the materialization of its trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation besides contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend in the public it bears highlighting that since the beginning of this important decisions have been taken and which support the vision that a fiscal consolidation process is in the copom highlights that its main scenario for inflation also considers moderation in credit for which macroprudential and traditional monetary policy actions recently adopted still about this the committee considers opportune the introduction of initiatives in the direction of moderating subsidies concession through credit operations in the copom recognizes an economic environment in which an uncertainty level and identifies risks to the materialization of a scenario where inflation promptly converges to the midpoint since the last copom at the external stimuli factors and their assets prices spillovers have pointed to lower probability of reversion in the recovery process experienced by the from another they still reveal the ambiguous influence of the international outlook over domestic inflation regarding the domestic macroprudential actions conventional monetary policy actions recently implemented will still have their effects incorporated to price although uncertainties that surround the global outlook at a minor the domestic do not allow the clear identification of the degree of persistence of recent inflationary the committee evaluates that the inflation prospective scenario has not evolved the copom understands unanimously due to uncertainties regarding the high persistency of recent inflation and to the complexity that currently involves the international the interest rate total adjustment should from this meeting sufficiently in spite of this two visions in one part of committee understands that the risks balance in the main scenario suggests the maintenance of the selic adjustment pace implemented in the first quarter of this year to mitigate risks that recent inflation pressures be transmitted to the prospective on the other the majority of the committee understands that a substantial effort was already introduced in the economy in the last four months and that there is a time gap in the transmission mechanism of this effort to the activity and to associated to the decision to extend the adjustment would recommend a strategic reassessment of the monetary in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom decided to increase the selic rate to without by five votes in against two for the increase of the selic rate by considering the risks balance for the the rhythm yet uncertain of the domestic activity as well as the complexity that currently affects the international the committee considers in this the implementation of adjustment in monetary conditions by a sufficiently long period is the most adequate strategy to guarantee the inflation convergence to the target in domestic demand is largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and credit although recent initiatives point to some constraint in public sector fiscal and credit incentives provided to the economy in the last quarters should still contribute for the activity expansion for the maintenance of the idleness level of factors at low the effects of these are counterbalanced by the effects of the reversal of initiatives taken during the recent financial by the recent macroprudential actions by conventional monetary policy actions taken this these elements and the fiscal and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets at the end of the meeting it was announced that the committee will reconvene on june for technical presentations on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom the ipca rose in from in february and in according to ibge in the first quarter of this the index grew in the last twelve months through advancing relatively from the registered in market prices inflation decreased from in february to in reflecting the decrease from to in the prices of by the lower increase in the prices of from to the prices of tradable goods increased in march compared to in the previous regulated driven by air tickets and increased up from in the groups transports and food

reduced and ipc an incc the ipa increased up from in accumulating in the first quarter of the year and in twelve agricultural prices increased in down from in accumulating in the year and in twelve industrial products prices increased in down from in accumulating in the year and in twelve agricultural the reduction was influenced by the sharp fall of soybean compared to in and by reduction in

consumer goods in the year and on a trailing basis through industrial production increased by and compared to the same previous with highlights for production of capital the nuci in the manufacturing

jobs per month in the first quarter of the in the euro consumption remains due to the high unemployment rate and the fiscal austerity in with aggregate growth in the region being led by energetic commodity prices have registered significant increase since the last copom reflecting the worsening of the geopolitical tension in the middle east and north of in addition to the prospect of increase in the demand for alternative sources of energy in in the same metallic and agricultural commodities have performed the combination of commodity imports by improvements in the prospects for the harvest in south america and uncertainties regarding the impacts of the earthquake in japan over the global economy provoked strong reductions in the prices of these as of the prices of metallic and agricultural commodities resumed reflecting the depreciation of the dollar and the still tight equilibrium between supply and demand in the markets of several of these in the fx the dollar maintained its depreciation this trend was reinforced by the start of the normalization of the monetary policy in the euro zone and by the continuity of the quantitative easing policy adopted by the federal reserve the upward pressures stemming from the prices of energy and food continued to reflect in global inflation in annual cpi increased both in the us and in the euro and in core inflation have

advanced economies remain and there was stability in the volatility and risk aversion despite negative shocks in the financial system in the euro high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political are translated into projections of low growth for advanced mainly in the compound leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development related to continues to indicate growth in the united states and in with possible recover of activity levels in the euro on its the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index related to

program for the monetary base with potential positive effects over economic activity and in the asset especially in the southeast in the emerging in monetary policy is inflation has remained at moderate levels in the us and in the euro and negative in the price of brent oil barrel has since the previous copom for a level close to it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom the international prices of metallic commodities have retreated while the agricultural ones have increased on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a change of in the twelve months through march assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline price in was maintained at unchanged relative to the march copom the projected adjustment for household electricity price points to a decrease of nearly unchanged relative to the march copom this estimate considers the direct impacts of the sector charges reductions recently as well as readjustments and ordinary tariff revisions planned for this for bottled gas prices are projected to remain stable and fixed telephone tariff is projected to decrease the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in remained at unchanged relative to the march copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the march copom this projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus of according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for as a working a primary surplus of billion is according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law project the set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased from to for the median of the inflation expectations increased from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of the expectations for the ipca changed from and to and for the median of expectations changed from and to and in the same the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation remained relative to the figure considered at the march copom meeting and stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin with market in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast but is above the midpoint inflation for inflation forecast increased relative to the figure considered at the march copom meeting and stands above the midpoint inflation in baseline according to the market ipca inflation forecast but is above the midpoint inflation policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom understands that there were significant structural changes in the brazilian which determined retreat in interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction in risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the ninth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of the decreasing trend for the public for the all these transformations are characterized by high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian current solid indicators of solvency and the copom also evaluates that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding according to the are largely permanent have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability remained particularly those derived from the ongoing deleveraging process in the main economic in this despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains the committee evaluates in the prospects for moderate global activity remained with trend of intensification over the relevant in this there are localized improvements in advanced although the space to use monetary policy remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has supported by the resilience of domestic the committee also highlights evidences of accommodation of international commodities the copom evaluates despite the limitations in the supply the pace of domestic economic activity intensified in the first it notes that recent data point to a resumption of investment and a growth in the relevant more in line with potential the committee notes that the domestic demand will continue to be driven by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions recently as well as the moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and the domestic activity will continue to be favored by the public as well as by the strength the labor which is reflected in historically low unemployment rates and wages despite some accommodation at the the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal despite recent initiatives point to an expansionist position of the public sector the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth strengthens the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit still regarding the credit the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating the concessions of subsidies through credit the copom emphasizes that its main scenario includes more intense domestic activity in this an in the upcoming in this the committee highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation it bears noticing the recently observed moderation in the price dynamics of some real and financial in the assumption of remaining at the current will constitute disinflationary the copom evaluates that the high inflation level and the dispersion of price among other contribute for inflation to show resistance and demand a monetary policy on the other the committee considers that domestic external uncertainties surround the prospective scenario for inflation and recommend that monetary policy should be administered with the judgment of all the copom members is convergent with respect to the need for a monetary policy action aimed at neutralizing risks that arise in the prospective scenario for especially for the next part of the considers that there is an ongoing reassessment of global growth and that this depending on its intensity and may cause positive impacts over domestic prices for those members of the an immediate action of monetary policy would not be this view was not supported by the majority of the in this the copom decided to increase the selic rate to without with six votes for the monetary policy action and two votes in favor of maintaining the selic rate in the following members of the committee voted for the increase of the selic rate to alexandre antonio tombini altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the following member of the committee voted for the maintenance of the selic rate at aldo luiz mendes and luiz awazu pereira da the copom evaluates that the domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and for the these the programs of public services the inventories at adjusted levels and the gradual recovery of confidence create prospects for investments intensification and industrial production the committee considers that recent initiatives point to an expansionist position of the public sector on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario still represents an aggregate demand restraining these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom emphasizes that the international in which it is ratified by the brazilian shows that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of businesses and as well as in the deterioration of the the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates subtract the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income the monetary policy committee notes in moments such as the current the monetary policy must remain especially vigilant in order to minimize risks that high inflation as the observed in the last twelve persist through the relevant horizon for monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on may for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the ipca changed in compared to in increasing by in the twelve months

underpinning this it bears highlighting the disclosure of still more pressured current inflation including the various core the maintenance of inflation projections at high levels and expectations of agents regarding the start of the tightening cycle by the central between march and april and sixmonth interest rates increased by and the rates for and maturities increased by and the real interest measured by the ratio between the nominal interest rate and the inflation expectation for the next twelve increased from on march to on april a movement that resulted from the combined effect of rising nominal interest rates and lower inflation on march the bcb carried out reverse fx swap auctions maturing on may in an amount equivalent to on march the bcb carried out traditional fx swap maturing on may with an amount equivalent to the previous as a result of the operations in the the bcb had its net position in foreign exchange swap contracts reduced to in managing the liquidity of

such overnight operations was billion in the the overall daily average of the total outstanding of repurchase agreements of the bcb increased from billion between january and march to billion between march and april considering the period between march and april the outstanding of repurchase agreements increased from billion to the main factor driving the liquidity expansion in the period was the net redemption of securities by the national ipca inflation declined in march and reached down from in the previous month and in as a inflation totaled in the first quarter of the above the expectations that prevailed at the close of but below inflation registered in the same period last year the main driver of the quarterly ipca inflation result was the behavior of regulated which increased compared to in the same period of while market prices increased in the first up from in the same quarter of trailing inflation through march reached compared to in march for this market prices contributed whilst regulated prices accounted for to and in march inflation deceleration in march was a result of market prices inflation decline down from in contrast with regulated prices inflation acceleration up from in it bears emphasizing the upward pressure of food and the prices of tradable goods increased in up from in while the prices of goods increased in compared to in services inflation reached in the month and in the last twelve months of courses increased while other services increased despite the recent inflation acceleration observed at the end of and the start of the most likely scenario is that inflation evolves according to the targets ipca core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices also decreased in march down from in in line with the headline ipca inflation on the other the other underlying core inflation measures calculated by the bcb slightly smoothed trimmed means core increased in up from in february and continued to record the strongest rigidity among the three core while the trimmed means core increased up from in the first core inflation by exclusion recorded the lowest level since while smoothed and nonsmoothed trimmed means core measures totaled and record lows for the this behavior is also present on the trailing basis through when cores reached and the general price index inflation remained virtually unchanged on a basis in march compared to in leading such as the suggest that the stability should in the first the index increased by up from in the same period last in the twelve months through it reached up from in this behavior was among other by the recovery of agricultural which presented monthly deflation results last among the the increased by in up from in while the increased up from on the other the wholesale price index inflation increased in down from in the decline in inflation was due to agricultural prices which recorded after increasing and respectively in january and as highlighted in previous copom the effects of wholesale prices over consumer inflation will depend on prospective demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation after the last copom the ibge released new gdp as a result of the implementation of comprehensive methodological the new data showed significant adjustments in the gdp level and in growth with the last average rate increasing to up from in to up from among other important there was a substantial decline in the investment the new set of data also suggests that the at least could be using the factors of production in a more efficient another important change was the expansion of services in the gdp which suggests that the brazilian economy profile is closer to those of other important according to the new gdp on the supply agriculture grew as against previously and services increased by as against while industrial growth recording as against on the demand there were increases in gross fixed capital formation as against household consumption as against and in government consumption as against while exports growth declined as against and imports expansion was kept unchanged according to ibge seasonally adjusted data for gdp increased slightly below the rate previously while gdp increased well above the rate previously in line with the analysis of previous copom after expanding in the three last months of and declining in industrial production resumed growth in increasing by with manufacturing industry and mining expanding by and according to ibge seasonally adjusted compared to february industrial production increased by the eight consecutive month of aggregate industrial production in the last twelve industrial production expanded by with for manufacturing industry and for on a moving average industrial output grew by the eleventh consecutive month in the expansion of manufacturing industry in february reached out of activities with seasonally adjusted for leading and coincident indicators suggest the continuity of the ongoing the several incentive factors to economic including the monetary easing already suggest that the expanding trend in industry shall continue in the upcoming disaggregated industrial data showed seasonally adjusted expansion of in durable consumer goods production in compared to the same month last capital goods production strongly expanded by while intermediate goods production increased by according to the same comparison durable goods production contracted by in the first two months of the capital goods production expanding by and the pace of intermediate goods production increasing by the dynamics of capital goods production reflects positive prospects for the growth of domestic demand and the influence of favorable international prices in several in the expansion of intermediate goods production suggests a more generalized acceleration in industrial after declining between august and december last reaching the unemployment rate reached in january and in in line with the seasonal pattern at the start of the compared to the same month last unemployment showed the number of workers grew in the twelve months through indicating robust pace of job the purchasing power of workers increased and compared to the same month last this dynamics is also present in real which increased in february in the compared to february maintaining the upward trend and sustaining the growth of aggregate according to the national industry confederation data seasonally adjusted by the manufacturing employment increased in the fifteenth consecutive monthly compared to february manufacturing industry increased by regarding formal data from the ministry of labor and employment confirms the continuity of expansion in with the creation of thousand a expansion on a seasonally adjusted in the first two months of the formal job creation grew and in the last twelve after the slight decline in which interrupted a expansion retail sales strongly increased in the first two months of the according to data seasonally adjusted by the retail sales expanded and in january and when compared to the same months last retail sales expanded in january and in still under this comparison both months reached record highs for the series begun in january in the year through retail sales expanded significantly by compared to the same period last a record high for this period since the start of the in addition to the strong expansion of sales more linked to it bears emphasizing the positive performance of items more sensitive to income and for and supermarket sales expanded by in the first two months of the expanded retail which include the sales of civil construction material and parts and increased in the first two months of the compared to the same period of for the rest of the it is expected the continuity of retail sales boosted by the increase in employment and credit the monetary easing process and by the recovery of consumer installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry reached in above that observed in the same month of according to the new series released by cni and seasonally adjusted by the compared to the same month last the february result reached the seventh consecutive monthly this rate was below the record high of the new observed in july difference totaled in disaggregated indicators compiled by the fgv signaled a record in the capacity utilization of capital goods in the higher average capacity utilization recently observed reflects the intensification of economic data regarding such as the increase in the absorption of capital goods in the first two months of the suggest a robust ongoing expansion of sustained by both imports and capital goods the production of inputs for civil construction also despite at a lower and expanded by in the first two relevant imbalances between aggregate supply and demand are not anticipated as stressed in previous copom inflation trajectory is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply of goods and services to adequately meet demand trade balance continues to record robust results at the start of confirming analysis expressed in previous copom minutes about important structural changes in the brazilian external in the first the trade surplus reached lower than that observed in the same period last this cooling was and was due to billion exports and billion imports in the and higher than the amounts recorded in the first quarter of despite lower trade surpluses are a natural consequence of both higher activity level and strengthened showing a healthy process of external adjustment the current account surplus stood at billion in the first totaling billion in the twelve months through or of with regard to the international uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy stance in the us although additional interest rate increases cannot be the consensus points to the fact that an easing monetary policy cycle could start this the possibility of a deceleration in the us economy cannot be and its effects on the global on the other brazilian economy and asset prices have been showing significant resilience against swings in international financial due to better fundamentals in recent and favorable exports in addition to showing resilience to market the brazilian economy trails a growth cycle with price the copom continues to consider that international financial market conditions are oil another systematic source of international still present high with a slight increase since the last copom among other geopolitical despite the uncertainties surrounding the future oil prices the main scenario considered by the which attributes no change to domestic gasoline prices in continues assessment of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the march copom the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at considering the same comparison the projection for fixed telephone price adjustments in decreased to from while the projection for household electricity price adjustments decreased to from the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to from of the march copom these according to the weights released by the represented of the total march the projection for regulated prices inflation in decreased to from this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated this model considers the effects of seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the general price index the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the stood at in the fourth quarter of reaching in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the march copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group decreased to from this reduction was mainly driven by lower estimates for and ahead inflation expectations decreased to down from for inflation expectations remained at as mentioned in previous these developments suggest the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period increased compared to the values considered at the march copom remaining below the target established by the cmn for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting slightly decreased relative to the values considered in the march copom remaining below the central target for the the projection for inflation slightly reduced in relation to the march remaining below the target in the benchmark scenario and above the target in the market monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data still do not suggest high probability of important pressures over inflation in the imports expansion has contributed significantly to this complementing domestic production limiting potential inflationary effects of aggregated demand sustained despite the prospects of lower liquidity in international due to the interest rates increase in industrialized and the volatility increase in the global the external outlook remains particularly regarding brazilian external the copom continues to assign low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market the prospects for the inflation trajectory remain as in recent the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of the monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the consolidation of positive developments anticipated for the the copom evaluates that the relatively high inflation monthly which have persisted since the end of do not represent yet a risk to the inflation part of the inflation increase at the start of the year is due to such as the elevation of food and seasonal such as tuition fees in addition to certain pressures over services due to the nature of such they are expected to dampen throughout without necessarily affecting the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation measures in the upcoming discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally follow as a consequence of this improved the copom evaluates that its cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the targets for this to it is important that forwardlooking inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation outlook observed in the last the copom once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated in the last nine the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the economic activity resumption on inflation have not completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the prospective inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses occurred in and expected for the next quarters of the the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the signs of heated aggregate inflation and the fact that the monetary policy decisions should have concentrated effects in the last months of in in light of the existing incentives for expanding aggregate the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission the lower distance between the current selic rate and the equilibrium interest and the interest rate cuts implemented since september the copom members understood that the preservation of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real demands a more cautious monetary easing even in this copom participants believe that there are several signs showing that the imports contribution to the consolidation of a benign scenario for through the limits exerted on tradable prices in a robust aggregate demand may be stronger than initially as a during the decision process regarding the monetary easing three members of the committee understood that the balance of risks to the evolution of the future inflation considering the perspectives for both market and regulated would justify a reduction in the selic target the majority of the committee maintained the assessment considering the extension of the easing process already the remaining uncertainties regarding the lagged impacts of the monetary the expected behavior of the other sustaining factors of such as income in a scenario of solid expansion of the domestic demand for tradable and goods and and of economic activity continued to recommend the maintenance of the reduction pace in the selic target given the reasons stated the copom decided to continue the monetary easing started in the september and reduced the selic target rate to without four votes were for the copom monetary policy while three votes were in favor of reducing the selic target by basis under an the monetary authority decides according to inflation analyzing alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine price dynamics and the balance of risks associated to the although uncertainties regarding the us economic performance the international scenario remains contributing to a positive domestic inflation on the other price apparently punctual and hit the economy at a moment when domestic demand already expands sustaining the economic activity including sectors little exposed to external when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already have not completely in such the monetary authority must remain so that uncertainties do not contaminate longer time at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on june for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca inflation increased in down from in the slight decrease was mainly driven by the exhaustion of the education costs readjustments after the seasonal increase that influenced the february ipca food and beverages prices increased up from in the previous and are responsible for of the ipca monthly overall for the higher elevation of food with the monthly the ipca maintained the deceleration totaling in twelve months and in the first quarter of the market prices inflation totaled in down from in while regulated prices increased up from in the same in twelve market prices accumulated and regulated among market goods prices increased mainly because of the elevation in the prices of while the prices of tradable goods increased the trimmed means core measures slightly increased in while the core excluding household food and regulated prices decreased on a trailing all core measures maintained a declining the trimmed means core reached in the up from in totaling in twelve smoothed trimmed means core increased in up from in totaling in twelve the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in down from in the previous and accumulated in twelve the increased in compared to in totaling in the year through march and in the last twelve among the only the ipa prices the with the largest weight in the decelerated in totaling down from in the increased in the up from in mainly driven by higher rates in of its composing mainly the core under the smoothed trimmed means method calculated by fgv increased in up from in the previous totaling in the year through march and in twelve the increased in up from in as a consequence of higher labor costs driven by wage increases in salvador and rio de services and materials increased in down from in the changed in the year through and in the last twelve the lower ipa inflation in march reflected the reduction of agricultural which offset the impact of industrial prices the agricultural ipa inflation totaled down from the rise in while the industrial ipa grew up from in the previous according to the three stages of only raw materials showed a negative price after a growth in the previous the prices of final goods increased up from in while the prices of intermediate goods totaled up from in the same in the twelve months through the prices of raw materials grew pressuring the ipa result in the the prices of intermediate and final goods increased by and economic activity gdp grew in according to new in comparison to in the previous expansion was generalized through all production regarding the production the crop and livestock sector expanded by while industrial and service sectors grew by and on the demand there were increases in gross fixed capital formation household consumption government consumption exports and imports the external sector contributed to gdp while domestic demand plus was responsible for in product with a variation due to inventories according to monthly retail sales increased in on a seasonally adjusted among the activities composing the general there were increases in the sales of fuel and lubricants and and food beverages and tobacco there were decreases in the sales of clothing and shoes and furniture and home appliances vehicles and parts and comprised in the expanded retail increased in on a regional out of the brazilian states showed positive results in compared to february piauí was the only compared to february retail sales increased this figure results from growth in all sales mainly furniture and home appliances and hypermarkets regarding the expanded retail it bears emphasizing the performance of automobiles sales retail sales performance reflects the continuity of payroll growth and better credit in the first two months of retail sales expansion reached compared to the same period of still compared to february expanded retail which include civil construction inputs and vehicles and their parts and increased in last in the first two months of the expanded index grew mainly due to the increases of and in the sales of vehicles and civil construction são paulo trade association relative to the city of são paulo and seasonally adjusted by the showed increases in database consultations for credit sales and in consultations to the usecheque system in compared to march there were increases of and regarding investment domestic production of capital goods and civil construction inputs increased and in february on a seasonally adjusted capital goods imports fell according to the same comparison after two consecutive months of accelerated in twelve months through last these indices grew and according to the same comparison capital goods production for energy increased for mixed for typically industrial and for civil capital goods production for agriculture reduced in the twelve months through after a fall in the twelve months through the previous signaling a marginal trend credit operations for and investments reached billion in the first quarter of exceeding by those disbursed in the first quarter of in the twelve months through total operations increased emphasizing the recent acceleration of this the growth in demand for and financing is also evident by the total amount involved in financing consultations registered by the bndes in march around above the figure recorded in march according to monthly industrial survey industrial production increased in february on a seasonally adjusted reaching the record high of december industrial production increased compared to february with cumulative changes of in the first two months of and in the twelve months through considering seasonally adjusted industrial output in february was driven by increases of and in mining and manufacturing all use categories recorded production increases in the with highlights to durable consumer goods consumer goods and intermediate goods capital goods production remained roughly stable in february after three consecutive positive on a yearly capital goods expanded by with a elevation in the first two months of the disaggregated analysis of seasonally adjusted industrial activity data showed that of the sectors surveyed grew in with according to their respective contributions to overall to oil refining and alcohol production electronic materials and communication equipment and food the main negative drivers were machines and electric equipment machines and equipment and basic metallurgy still considering the industrial according to cni seasonally adjusted by the hours worked in production rose and real sales remained stable in in comparison to the previous in the first two months of these indicators increased ad in comparison to the same period of installed capacity utilization posted at in close to the of in the seasonally adjusted considering the observed installed capacity utilization reached in last leveling above the february vehicles production reached a monthly record high in march thousand according to the this figure corresponds to a increase compared to the same month of and to a according to seasonally adjusted also in seasonally adjusted domestic sales rose while exports decreased compared to the first quarter of vehicles production and domestic sales increased and and exports fell the production of agricultural machines rose in the first quarter of compared to the same period of reflecting the recovery in the current according to the the march estimate for crops harvest in the year is above the previous year national production of legumes and vegetables should reach million due to good weather conditions and the production incentives resulting from the elevation of international prices of agricultural soy and corn are the main drivers of the expansion in grains production this it bears emphasizing the increase in land occupation for sugar cane driven by the growing interest in ethanol sugar cane lands increased in and the estimate production is higher than that recorded in the previous surveys and expectations the survey showed stability in the consumer confidence index in after a significant drop in the current economic conditions index increased and the consumer expectation index decreased signalizing that consumers are more cautious with the future economic in for the fourth consecutive the icea remained above the according to the fgv which encompasses two thousand homes in the seven main state capitals of the the icc declined in this result is due to the deterioration in both the assessment of the present situation and in the ahead still according to the industry confidence index which encompasses six items of the manufacturing industry increased in for an cumulative increase in the first quarter of compared to the same quarter of on a there were increases of in the assessment about the present situation and in the expectations for the upcoming market according to the ministry of labor and new jobs were created in february the result is the second best for the since the beginning of the series in only below the february when new jobs were in the first two months of the year thousand new jobs were compared to thousand in the same period of after seasonal the employment index increased in the with increases in all in the last twelve the expansion reached with highlights to the increase in civil construction according to the ibge employment survey in the six main metropolitan areas of the the unemployment rate reached in compared to in the previous month and in february the unemployment rate change reflects mainly the population as economically active population has remained almost stable in the the number of employed workers decreased in totaling about thousand the number of formal employed workers in the private sector increased while the number of informal workers decreased confirming the increase trend of formal of labor with positive results over productivity and labor in the first two months of the number of informal workers fell while the number of formal workers increased by according to the same real average earnings reached in a increase and a elevation compared to february real payrolls increased in and maintained a yearly rising with an increase in compared to the same month last according to industrial employment increased in seasonally in the first two months of expansion totaled real payrolls in industry increased in compared to the same month in accumulating a expansion in the first

external environment after the turbulence in the stock markets at the end of concerns returned to the degree of downturn in the us economy mainly in the residential housing sector and to the evolution of us which were present in the last federal open market committee in the euro the european central bank maintained the interest rate at in the last but stressed that the risks to the inflation dynamics persist and that the monetary authority will be vigilant to any price other central banks issuing international currencies reaffirmed their intention to contain inflationary in terms of global economic activity the international monetary fund presented new projections to world forecasting two more years of vigorous economic growth in and with developing countries reaching higher growth rates than developed countries and according to the the risks to global growth declined and are the main risks are concentrated in the performance of the us with special reference to the housing and in the possibility of a adjustment in global at the same time that the imf recognizes that global economic conditions have underpinned a favorable financial also admits that the underlying risks can potentially weaken the financial in the imf points out to a reduction in the macroeconomic risks and a slight increase in financial foreign trade and international reserves in the first quarter of brazilian foreign trade continued to trade surplus reached billion in the and billion in the twelve months through while total external trade totaled billion and according to the same trade surplus reached million in the first working days of exports totaled million whereas imports reached exports reached billion in a record high for the with a daily average of an increase over march

comparison in addition to shipment some important export products continued to present prices with highlights to orange juice metal laminates raw soy oil fuel alcohol and in the first quarter of exports continued to show diversification in terms of particularly regarding manufactured items with low share in total and expansion of exports imports totaled billion in a record high for the

and considering daily in international reserves reached totaling a billion increase in the billion in the and billion compared to march money market and open market operations the period after the march copom meeting through the yield curve remained influenced by the negative behavior of us housing sector since the yield curve shifted downward due to lower concerns about the us economic in light of the positive results of labor market and activity the release of the fomc statement on march contributed to deepen the fall of the yield due to its positive spillovers for international stock markets and capital flows for emerging the performance of several macroeconomic including recent gdp growth and ratio resulting from the new measurement methodology by ibge boosted optimism and contributed to the decline of the brazil country reaching new record and of the interest mainly between march and april and rates reduced and and rates declined and influenced by the favorable current inflation trajectory and inflation the real interest rate measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the smoothed ahead inflation expectations decreased to on april down from on march on march and on april the bcb conducted a reverse exchange rate swap aimed at anticipating the redemption of the swaps due april and may totaling in its open market the bcb carried from march to april weekly and long fixed rate repo the average daily balance of these operations amounted of which billion were in the same the bcb also conducted overnight repo of which aimed at draining the excess liquidity from the the bcb also conducted daily liquidity management operations with tenures up to two working operations with tenors less than thirty including daily liquidity management averaged between march and april the national treasury raised a total of of which billion in billion via issuance of ltns maturing in and and billion in maturing in and issuance of lfts

recorded in june as a inflation in twelve months reached in july in july market prices changed in twelve months in july and regulated in july among market the prices of tradable goods increased in twelve months in july and the prices of in july on its the prices of the food and beverages group increased in the same period in july and the prices of services rose until july in available information suggest some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services the average of the underlying monthly inflation calculated by the changed from in june to in as a on a trailing average core inflation reached above the one registered in july the double weight core inflation changed from in june to in the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household from to and the core by which excludes ten household food items and from to on its the trimmed means ipca core inflation changed from to and the smoothed trimmed means ipca core from to the diffusion index stood at in july above the one recorded in july the general price index after decreasing in decreased in reaching on a trailing basis in july the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in twelve months in july with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and of in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through july in july the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in july partially driven by pressures stemming from the labor which increased in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics decreased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of the economic in june the changed seasonally the composite purchasing index regarding brazil reached in pointing to marginal decline in the private sector production for the fifth consecutive with the first increase in manufacturing sector since march being partially offset by a moderate decrease in the service on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation after increasing for two decreased in reaching the lowest level since april the industrial businessmen measured by the industry confidence index and the services confidence index both from decreased in august for the eighth consecutive month and both also reached the lowest level since april regarding the agricultural production systematic assessment carried out by the ibge in july indicates that grains production is expected to grow by in relative to the the gross domestic product decreased in the second quarter of after decreasing in the previous according to data seasonally adjusted by the it decreased in the second quarter to in the first focusing on the aggregate demand household consumption increased in the second quarter of according to seasonally adjusted and compared to same quarter of on its the government consumption decreased at the margin and expanded compared to the same quarter of the previous the fixed capital gross formation decreased and compared to the same quarter of after decreasing for five consecutive the industrial activity increased in according to the seasonally adjusted released by the according to the observed industrial production decreased in accumulating a decrease of in the compared to the same month of the previous negative results were observed in out of the main economic categories and in out of the surveyed according to data released by the national confederation of industry real revenue in the manufacturing industry decreased between may and june according to the seasonally adjusted the pmi of the industrial on its in the first expansion in five among the use according to the july and seasonally adjusted data the highest increase was observed in durable consumer goods followed by capital goods and and goods on the other intermediate goods decreased regarding only and goods increased the capital and intermediate goods sectors decreased and the ibge data releasead by the monthly employment survey in july covered only out of the metropolitan areas usually due to the in this data referring to salvador and porto alegre are yet to be the unemployment rate in july remained stable in the four metropolitan areas whose results were the unemployment rate declined in rio de in in são paulo and in belo data released by the ministry of labor and employment show that thousand formal jobs were created in the lowest net generation for the month since in the available data indicate narrow idleness margin in the labor although evidences show some signs of accomodation at the according to the retail monthly survey released by the the retail sales volume increased in compared to june on its broad retail sales which includes vehicles and construction decreased in according to the same comparison the changes were and according to the seasonally adjusted in twelve the broad retail sales growth rate stood at with expansion in eight out of the ten surveyed the trade confidence index measured by the fell in reflecting the deterioration of the current and reached the new historical low since march the copom evaluates that the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by the moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal reached in august according to the seasonally adjusted it reached among the industry use the ones showing the highest according to the seasonally adjusted are construction material and intermediate goods followed by durable consumer goods capital goods and consumer goods on its the absorption of capital goods decreased in the last twelve months through the trailing trade balance result reached billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in with increase of and decrease of compared to the twelve months through august on its the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months reached billion in equivalent to of the on the other foreign direct investment totaled according to the same comparison equivalent to of the regarding the global leading indicators signal growth prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political uncertainties constitute elements constraining investments and regarding the monetary the federal reserve has continued the process of reduction of the purchase in accommodative stances prevail in the advanced in the emerging less accommodative monetary policy stances inflation remains at moderate or low levels in the advanced in the emerging it stands at higher the price of the brent oil barrel has remained at a level near since the previous copom it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand components and the fact that supply growth depends on long term risky investment since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have fallen and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through july of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in the same value considered in the july copom this projection considers gasoline and bottled gas price changes until july and as well as assumptions of a reduction in fixed telephone tariffs and the increase of in electricity the items for which there are more information were projected and for the the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for the same value considered in the july copom for the projected regulated price change is against considered in the july copom the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis point and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus both for and according to the parameters set out in the budget guidelines law and in the budget guidelines law project in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca fell from to for the median of the inflation projections increased from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom but remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council in the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also fell relative to the value considered at the july but remains above the inflation for according to both the inflation forecast remained stable above the inflation for the early quarters of the forecasts indicate that inflation enters in a convergence policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over confidence and high inflation rates reduce the growth potential of the as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains for the despite recently released data have been less positive than the prospects for more intense global activity throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary policy have there are improvements in advanced with recovery of activity in some countries and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the space to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and the fiscal restraint scenario prevails in this and in the upcoming in important emerging the activity pace has not matched the despite the resilience of the domestic the committee highlights the evidences of tension and volatility focuses in the as well as the prospects of moderation in the dynamics of prices in the international despite recently observed localized the copom considers that the expansion rates of domestic absorption and gdp rates have and that the domestic activity expansion pace tends to be less intense this compared to in the medium the committee evaluates that important changes must take place in the composition of aggregate supply and in this the consumption tends to grow at a more moderate pace than the observed over the recent and the investments tend to gain regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of greater global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy focusing on the supply the committee evaluates in the long more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have and that the services sector tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the committee also highlights that the speed of materialization of the aforementioned changes and their resulting gains depend on the strengthening of and the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal variables and the arising of the conditions so in the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector shifts to the neutral the committee also notes that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered in the inflation projections would contribute to create a positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also bears emphasizing that the generation of primary surpluses at levels close to the average generated over the recent years would contribute to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in which would stimulate private investment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate credit important to highlight the fact after years of strong expansion cooled with the introduction of macroprudential measures at the end of the credit market oriented to consumption underwent a so over the recent quarters it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by and on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another the committee considers opportune initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the factors the copom highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor market and it considers under such a significant risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over although the adjustment for the minimum this is not as significant as in the previous and considering the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimated for the labor productivity over the recent the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustments processes now underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee recognizes that these adjustments in relative prices have direct impacts on inflation and reaffirms its view that monetary policy can and should contain the second order effects arising from by the in order to fight these and other inflationary the monetary conditions were but the committee evaluates that the effects of the selic rates hikes on in will still it is plausible to claim in the presence of relatively low levels of the effects of monetary policy actions on inflation tend to be assessing the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario and the inflation the copom unanimously at this to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that the aggregate demand tends to be relatively robust in the relevant horizon for monetary on the one household consumption tends to record a moderate expansion due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit on the other relatively favorable financial the concession of public the broadening of oil exploration among other tend to support the expansion of these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets although inflation is still in high the copom evaluates that ongoing inflationary pressures present at the economy as those stemming from the processes of prices realignments previously mentioned and from wage gains incompatible with productivity gains tend to cool down to exhaust throughout the relevant horizon for the monetary considering shorter the shift of the output gap to the disinflationary side should be in this it is plausible to claim considering the maintenance of the monetary conditions that the strategy that does not include the reduction of the monetary policy instrument the inflation tends to enter in a trajectory of convergence to the target in the final quarters of the projection the copom highlights in moments such as the current the monetary policy should remain in order to minimize risks that high inflation such as the one observed in the last twelve persist in the relevant horizon for the monetary at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on october for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june the set of economic activity indicators released since the last copom meeting is consistent with a gradual recovery of the brazilian the economy continues to operate with a high level of economic reflected in the low industrial capacity utilization indexes in the unemployment the global outlook has been as global economic activity remains on a gradual recovery without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced this supports risk appetite towards emerging economies the committee judges that its baseline inflation scenario has evolved as inflation developments remain with various measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable this includes the components most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary inflation expectations collected by the focus survey retreated to around percent for and percent for expectations for and are around percent and the path of administered prices underlying the inflation scenarios produced by the copom assumes increases of percent for percent for and percent for the scenario with interest rate and exchange rate paths extracted from the focus survey among other exchange rates of and at the end of and this scenario assumes a path for the policy interest rate that ends and at percent per year and increases to during the course of under these the inflation projections stand around percent for percent for and percent for unless explicitly stated this update takes into account changes occurred since the september copom meeting risks around baseline inflation scenario the committee emphasizes that its baseline scenario involves risks in both on the one possible effects of the favorable food price shock and of low current levels of industrial goods and the possible propagation through inertial mechanisms of low inflation levels may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of a reversal of the current benign global outlook for emerging discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee discussed the evolution of economic activity in light of available all members agreed that the economy should remain on a gradual recovery whose signs are for in employment even at this initial as the recovery consumption growth should give way to resumption in softer economic activity data pertaining to august were as well as the prospects of a stronger recovery the committee emphasized the vision owing to the current levels of slack in the marginal revisions in the intensity of recovery would not lead to material revisions in the expected path for regarding the global the committee confirmed the recent favorable evolution of the global which shows a gradual economic without exerting excessive pressure on financial conditions in advanced the committee acknowledged that the continuing process of normalization of monetary policy in major countries led to slightly less accommodative global financial the impact on emerging economies has been limited so in this the copom reaffirmed that the brazilian economy shows a greater capacity to absorb occasional setbacks in the global given its robust balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospects of economic the copom bank of brazil out the risk for the brazilian economy of a reversal in this benign global in a context of frustration of expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout this and subsequent years and all members agreed that the prospects for inflation have evolved as the committee assessed the current situation of the domestic electric energy generation sector and incorporated the recent increase in tariffs into its baseline scenario for regarding monetary there was consensus as in the case of other possible relative price adjustments resulting from supply with anchored inflation monetary policy should only address the effects of these the committee reiterates that its reaction to possible changes in relative such as in food and possible adjustments of electric energy will be that monetary policy will follow the same principles in face of both inflationary and disinflationary supply the copom discussed the levels and path of including the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary these components show comfortable levels and a path compatible with convergence of inflation towards the copom assessed that monetary policy has the flexibility to react to risks in both the risk that effects of supply shocks and the propagation of the low current levels of inflation will lead to a prospective inflation as well as the risk of a setback in the global outlook in a context of frustration of expectations about the reforms and necessary the committee expressed the view that economic conditions with anchored inflation measures of underlying inflation running at comfortable inflation projections slightly below the target for and a high level of economic slack prescribe accommodative monetary with interest rates below the structural although estimates of this rate involve a high degree of committee members expressed an understanding that current real interest rates provide stimulus to the the copom understands that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will to reassess estimates of this rate over the committee understands for a given estimate of the length of the monetary easing the pace of easing depends on the stage of the without necessarily reflecting changes in its baseline scenario or risk all copom members agreed that the evolution of the outlook and the balance of risks since its meeting in september took place as and compatible with the selic rate reduction to percent per the committee then discussed the next step in conducting monetary policy and the appropriate pace of easing for the current stage of the provided that the outlook evolves according to the baseline and because of the stage of the easing a moderate reduction in the magnitude of easing at the next meeting seems adequate from the current the copom also assessed the extension of the cycle and the convenience of signaling steps subsequent to the next there was consensus in maintaining freedom of action and to postpone any guidance on future monetary policy decisions in order to incorporate new information on the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of the committee reaffirmed its preference for communicating conditionalities for the evolution of monetary which better transmits the economic rationality that guides their this contributes to increase transparency and improve copom in this it was once again emphasized that the easing process will continue to depend on the evolution of economic the balance of possible reassessments of the extension of the cycle and on inflation forecasts and all committee members once again emphasized that the approval and implementation of reforms notably those of a fiscal nature and adjustments in the brazilian economy are fundamental for the sustainability of the environment of low and stable for the full operation of monetary policy and for the reduction of the structural interest rate of

are fundamental for the resumption of bank of brazil activity and for the development of the brazilian monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of and the wide array of

update of economic outlook and the global environment has deteriorated marked by downward revisions on prospective global growth in an environment of strong and persistent inflationary pressures arising from the global recovery after the pandemic these pressures have intensified due to the increase of commodity prices in more by the wave in further prolonging the process of normalization in the supply of industrial the reorganization of global production already fueled by the war in is expected to intensify with the search for a greater regional arrangement of the supply of in these developments might have consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary pressures on global production of the growth of major economies has been revised down for and due to the expected reversal of the stimuli implemented during the long pandemic in particular by monetary policy negative growth revisions were also noted for partially reflecting the policy adopted by that central banks in developed and emerging countries have adopted a more contractionary stance against increased in some of these current interest rates are still at levels evaluated as the repricing of monetary policy in advanced the increase in risk and the change in the growth outlook have affected financial conditions in both advanced and emerging the committee has also discussed the growing risks involving a global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary turning to the brazilian the set of indicators released since the previous meeting suggests a growth rate above the indicators related to the labor market continue to recover and the release of the gdp pointed to a pace of raising the statistical for this household consumption continues to contribute in gross fixed capital formation contributed consumer inflation remains with increases spread among several and continues to be more persistent than the inflation of services and of industrial goods remain and the recent shocks continue to cause a strong increase in food and recent readings were higher than expected and the surprise came in both the more volatile components and on items associated with core the inflation of the components most sensitive to the economic cycle and the monetary policy continues and the various measures of underlying inflation standing above the range compatible with meeting the inflation inflation expectations for and collected by the focus survey are around and scenarios and risk in the reference the interest rate path is extracted from the focus and the exchange rate starts at and evolves according to the purchasing power parity this scenario assumes a path for the selic rate that ends at falls to in and in the committee decided to keep the assumption that oil prices follow approximately the futures market curve for the following six ending the year at usd and then start increasing per year in january the energy flag is assumed to be in december and in this inflation projections stand at for for and for inflation projections for administered prices are for for and for the projections based on the reference scenario do not incorporate the tax measures on and telecom prices under the approval the committee judges that the uncertainty in its assumptions and projections is higher than usual and has increased since the previous the committee assesses that the global inflationary scenario continues to be marked by inflationary pressures stemming from both persistently high demand for goods and supply shocks linked to the war in ukraine and the committee further believes that recent policies restricting trade in agricultural products in coupled with the effects of the war in bring additional risk to global inflationary in the these developments might have consequences and lead to more persistent inflationary the committee then discussed the growing risks involving a sharper global deceleration in a highly pressured inflationary the committee already anticipates a slowdown in global activity in the coming due to geopolitical tensions and the monetary policy as well as financial conditions underway in several central the committee believes that the global synchrony in the process of stimulus withdrawal introduces additional risks to markets and may boost its impact on the prospective in this context of global copom considers a possible even if of the increase in international commodities measured in local currency observed in recent the committee reinforces that uncertainty about the future of the fiscal framework and fiscal policies that support aggregate demand may bring an upside risk to the inflationary scenario and to inflation the committee believes that recent domestic activity which have prompted a positive revision to still for the most the normalization process of the both in the higher consumption of services and in the utilization of the excess savings observed over historical and the transitory fiscal stimulus provided in the first half of the the committee assesses that activity should decelerate in the coming quarters when the lagged impacts of monetary policy will be more strongly the committee emphasizes that risks to its scenarios remain in both among the upside risks for the inflationary scenario and inflation it should be emphasized a greater persistence of global inflationary and the uncertainty about the future fiscal framework and fiscal policies that support aggregate partially incorporated in inflation expectations and asset among the downside it should be noted a possible even if of the increase in the price of international commodities measured in local and a greater deceleration of economic activity than the committee assessed that the tax measures under the approval process imply a sizable reduction in inflation in the current although they raise by a smaller magnitude inflation in the relevant horizon for monetary the committee assesses that the uncertain and volatile current scenario requires serenity when evaluating the discussion about the conduct of monetary copom discussed the conduct of monetary considering the set of projections as well as the balance of risks for prospective copom opened the discussion by evaluating the adjustment cycle carried out up to this it was emphasized that the current monetary tightening cycle was quite intense and timely and due to monetary policy much of the expected contractionary effect and its impact on current inflation are still to be copom observed deterioration in both the inflationary dynamics and the even though the scenario is surrounded by higher than usual uncertainty and the committee based on the projections used and on its balance of that the strategy required to bring the projected inflation to around the target for the relevant horizon on the one a terminal interest rate above that used in the reference scenario on the the maintenance of the interest rate in significantly contractionary territory for a longer period than that used in the reference the strategy of convergence around the target requires a more contractionary interest rate than that used in the reference scenario for the entire relevant copom then debated the monetary policy options for this the committee concluded that a further adjustment of was appropriate in an environment of high uncertainty and the significantly contractionary stage of monetary considering its should affect the economy more strongly as of the second half of the signaling for the next meeting was then given the persistence of the recent the committee evaluated that only the perspective of maintaining the selic rate for a sufficiently long period would not at this the convergence of inflation around the target in the relevant the committee then chose to signal a further of equal or smaller this strategy was deemed more appropriate to ensure the convergence of inflation over the relevant as well as the anchoring of inflation while reflecting the already implemented monetary reinforcing the cautious monetary policy and emphasizing the uncertainty of the monetary policy taking into account the assessed the balance of and the broad array of available the copom unanimously decided to increase the selic rate by to the committee judges that this decision reflects the uncertainty around its scenarios for prospective an even variance in the balance of risks and is consistent with the strategy for inflation convergence to a level around its target throughout the relevant horizon for monetary which includes without compromising its fundamental objective of ensuring price this decision also implies smoothing of economic fluctuations and fosters full the committee considers given its inflation projections and the risk of a deanchoring of it is appropriate to continue advancing in the process of monetary tightening significantly into even more restrictive the committee emphasizes that it will persist in its strategy until the disinflation process and the expectation anchoring around its targets for its next the committee foresees a new of the same or lower the committee stresses that the growing uncertainty of the current coupled with the advanced stage of the current monetary policy and its impacts yet to be require additional caution in its the copom emphasizes that its future policy steps could be adjusted to ensure the convergence of inflation towards its targets and will depend on the evolution of economic on the balance of and on inflation

that risks around its baseline scenario remain in both the one the possible through inertial of low inflation levels may lead to a prospective inflation on the other frustration of expectations regarding the continuation of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy may affect risk premia and increase the path for inflation over the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary this risk intensifies in the case of further changes in the global outlook for emerging the latter risk has intensified since the last copom discussion about the conduct of monetary the committee members discussed the evolution of the economic activity in light of available they agreed that the pace of the economic activity has at the this movement occurs amidst a process of consistent albeit at a gradual of the brazilian in this committee members believe as economic activity inflation tends to gradually return to they reaffirmed the view as a result of current levels of slack in the marginal revisions in the intensity of recovery would not lead to material revisions in the expected path for the global the committee considered that the scenario has become more the risk of a faster normalization of interest rates in some advanced economies induced changes in assets prices and volatility of financial conditions in international the baseline scenario comprises a gradual normalization of monetary policy in central but is dependent on the prospective path of price and wage inflation in these the committee members also mentioned the geopolitical risks and the risks associated to the continued expansion of international with possible impacts on global in this the copom members value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom bank of copom highlighted the economy capacity to withstand a setback in the international given its robust balance of low inflation anchored expectations and prospects of economic the copom pondered the risks derived from possible continuation of the reversal in the outlook for emerging in a context of frustration of the expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian in this they consider should the evolution of the global outlook produce relative price its impact on monetary policy will be circumscribed by its effects on inflation on the prices of economy not directly affected by the the copom analyzed the inflation trajectory throughout the current and subsequent all members agreed that inflation developments remain with several measures of underlying inflation running still at low this includes the components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and monetary they also discussed to what extent these trajectories are compatible with the convergence of inflation to the in the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary on the one persistence of underlying inflation measures at low levels poses downward risks for the prospective inflation on the other the recovery in economic activity is still expected to contribute to bring underlying inflation towards the target in the relevant risks associated with continuation of the reversal in the outlook for emerging in a context of frustration of the expectations regarding the necessary reforms and adjustments in the brazilian still the copom judges that the recent evolution of these dimensions as a has mitigated the risk of delayed convergence of inflation towards the the committee members also discussed the conditional projections for inflation in different in the scenario with interest and exchange rates extracted from the focus the projections showed slight decreases when compared to the projections produced at the time of the march copom in the scenario with constant interest and exchange as detailed in paragraph of these and projections are around slightly above the levels observed in the aforementioned the copom sees these levels as comfortable taking into account the current balance of deems that the odds that inflation remains below target in the relevant horizon have committee reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation in the face of occasional shocks that lead to changes monetary policy should focus on their effects the copom highlights that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be monetary policy will follow the same whether in the face of inflationary shocks in the case of an external shock leading to a devaluation of the exchange or in the face of disinflationary shocks in the case of a favorable food price having established how monetary policy should react to shocks that induce changes in relative copom members discussed the extent of rate in the brazilian they concluded that the intensity of depends on several such as the level of slack in the economy and the degree of anchoring of inflation the committee decided to monitor the different measures of to both inflation and underlying the copom members reaffirmed their understanding that economic conditions with anchored inflation underlying inflation measures at low inflation projections below target for and slightly below target for and high level of slack in the economy prescribes accommodative monetary interest rates below the structural

convergence of inflation to its copom understands that the process of reforms and necessary adjustments in the brazilian economy contributes to the reduction of its structural interest the committee will continue to reassess estimates of this rate over committee members then discussed the evolution of the baseline scenario and the balance of risks since its march meeting and the appropriate monetary policy decision in light of such they evaluated the alternative of reducing the basic interest rate by percentage point to in order to mitigate the risk of delayed convergence of inflation towards the some factors were in favor of this namely the low levels of inflation and underlying inflation and the gradual pace of recovery of the economy and its recent they then assessed the alternative of keeping the selic rate at in favor of this weighed the change in the balance of risks for inflation due to the external which bank of copom chances of inflation remaining below target in the relevant through possible effects on this made it unnecessary to mitigate the risk of an overly slow convergence of inflation to weighing the baseline scenario and the balance of the committee concluded that the decision to keep the interest rate at the current level was the most the members also evaluated the fact that recent communication by copom members appears to have been interpreted by the public as indicative of a decision to further reduce the interest in the the understanding prevailed that the focus on the best possible given the set of information available at the over in greater credibility for monetary the committee discussed the possible interpretation by economic agents that monetary policy would be reacting mechanically to recent exchange rate committee members understand that there may be impacts of the external shock on the brazilian but they emphasized that it is essential to understand that monetary policy will not react to these impacts since its implications for monetary policy depend on how the shock may be transmitted to to inflation and to the balance of in this the copom stated that the focus of monetary policy will be on the effects on inflation on the propagation to prices in the economy which are not directly affected by the and in a context of anchored inflation these effects tend to be mitigated by the high level of slack in the the committee also emphasized that its communication should reaffirm the conduct of monetary policy with exclusive focus on the evolution of inflation projections and of the balance of and of economic external shocks should be tackled only in the secondary impact they may have on prospective in this the committee concluded that the absence of a mechanical relationship between the external scenario and monetary policy will be evident over but that this should already be made explicit by the copom in its official based on all the copom members agreed to maintain the selic rate at they also

sufficient to stop this considering the recent behavior of capacity utilization the acceleration of investment and particularly their timely will be crucial to avoid relevant mismatches regarding the

recently issued data to some economic activity in europe and in the us is expected to slow the scenario points out to an easing monetary stance in mature at different paces in each on the other strong economic growth of main asian emerging which were apparently little affected by the us mortgage as well as the strength and steadiness of current expansion of other emerging even under increasing inflationary pressures and tight monetary have been fundamental factors to offset the effects of us economic the brazilian more does not seem to have been significantly affected by the recent and should sustain its growth essentially driven by domestic oil a systematic source of international not only remained at historically high levels but also continued highly this behavior in addition to structural changes in global energy recurrent geopolitical despite the significant uncertainties inherent to expectations about the future trend for oil the main scenario considered by the copom remains in which domestic gasoline prices remain unchanged in apart from the trajectory of domestic gasoline one should recognize that the elevation of international oil prices impacts the domestic both through productive such as the as well as by the deterioration of inflation the prices of other commodities have also presented high volatility in the last reflecting the increased uncertainty about the prospects for global demand growth and the turmoil on global financial in this the strong acceleration of food prices in several countries should also be as it makes the control of inflation by several central banks a more difficult of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following compared to the values considered in the october copom the projections for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in were both maintained at considering the previous the projections for electricity and fixed telephone prices adjustments in were changed to and the projection for regulated prices variation in remained at unchanged relative to the october this projection is based on the endogenous determination model for regulated which computes seasonal exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp the projection for the spreads over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap estimates a bps spread in the fourth quarter of under the benchmark the swap rate trajectory points to a spread in the last quarter of the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available regarding fiscal the projections assume the achievement of the target for the consolidated public sector primary surplus in and adjusted by the possibility of a reduction in this percentage due to the implementation of the ppi pilot the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the october copom median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investor relations group slightly increased to up from this elevation was due to the addition of the october inflation result and the raise of expected inflation in ahead inflation expectations changed more to up from considering the composition of monthly inflation market for inflation expectations remained at considering the hypotheses under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period the projection for the ipca increased compared to the value considered at the october copom but remained below the target established by the cmn for the according to the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the copom meeting ipca inflation forecast for also increased compared to the value considered at the october copom but remains below the central target for the the projection for based on both the benchmark and the market scenarios also increased in relation to the october but both remained below the policy decision the copom reaffirms the view expressed in previous that in addition to containing inflationary monetary policy has also contributed significantly for the consolidation of a favorable longterm macroeconomic economic activity data indicate that the intensity of demand expansion continue quite robust and can increase the probability of important pressures over inflation in the imports growth and the benign investment which continues to expand have contributed to slow down this despite uncertainties regarding the continuity of the rapid growth recorded in the international economy in the last years and the volatility increase observed in global markets in the last the prospects for brazilian external financing in the forecast period according to newly available that the balance of payments may not represent imminent risk to the inflation on the other the relevant inflation increase both in mature and emerging economies in recent months evidences the intensification of the inflationary risks on the global although inflation prospects remain in line with the targets additional uncertainties surround the inflation the copom emphasizes that the main challenge of monetary policy in this context is to guarantee the maintenance of positive results reached in the last the copom evaluates that the probability that emerging local inflationary pressures will represent risks to the domestic inflation trajectory has because the heated demand and market of factors can increase the of wholesale prices over consumer price the committee understands that the prospects for this as well as for the generalization of the pressures initially focused on consumer price depend mostly on inflation which remain carefully although the external sector can restrain the inflationary pressures in the tradable the heated domestic demand can trigger inflationary pressures in the for such as in the services in this the copom will continue to manage the monetary policy stance so that the gains obtained in inflation control in recent years become in this the copom will carefully monitor the evolution of inflation and the several core inflation as well as inflation expectations within the forecast discriminating between and persistent or generalized price and promptly adjusting the monetary policy stance to the the preservation of inflation rates in line with the targets path and the consolidation of a stable macroeconomic scenario will contribute to the progressive reduction of macroeconomic risk perception as a consequence of this improved the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally the copom evaluates that the persistence of a cautious monetary policy stance has been critical to increase the probability that inflation will continue to evolve according to the targets for this to it is important that inflation in particular the expected dynamic of aggregate supply and evolve in a harmonic the committee once that there are important time lags in the transmission of monetary policy stance to economic activity and since the beginning of the monetary easing in september the selic rate has already been reduced by with the bulk of the reduction concentrated the last nine neither has the activity level completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates cuts nor have the effects of the economic activity on inflation completely the evaluation of alternative monetary policy stances should necessarily focus on the inflation scenario and its instead of current inflation during the coming credit growth and payroll expansion should continue to bolster economic as mentioned in recent copom activity level should also reflect the effects of the possibly more intense expansion of governmental transfers and other fiscal impulses expected for the next the lagged effects of interest rates cuts on an increasingly robust aggregate demand will add up to other factors that will continue to contribute to this these issues become even more relevant considering the clear signs of heated aggregate and the fact that the monetary policy decisions will have effects as of the copom recognizes the important contribution of investment to expand productive this together with the external has helped to mitigate inflationary the copom evaluates that the pace of domestic demand which should continue to be among other by the impulse derived from the monetary policy easing implemented this may bring risks to the inflationary in this the consistent reduction of the mismatch between the rhythm of expansion of supply of goods and services and demand is even more relevant to the assessment of possibilities of monetary policy aiming at consolidating a stable and predictable the copom adopts a strategy to avoid a volatile inflationary this strategy takes into consideration the lags in the transmission mechanisms and has been the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and that is the reason why variables such as inflation the balance of risks associated to the scenario and especially the preventive stance in the process of the copom are so prudence assumes an even more important role in this like at the current when the deterioration of the balance of inflationary risks reduces the safety margin of the monetary in this considering the uncertainties associated with both the transmission mechanisms of the monetary policy and the prospective growth pace of aggregate supply and the committee unanimously decided to maintain the selic target rate at without this decision aims to preserve the gains in inflation control and to ensure that the strengthening of economic activity continues to be underpinned by solid under the the copom decides according to inflation the analysis of several alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine price prospective dynamics and its balance of domestic demand continues to expand economic activity including sectors little exposed to external at a time when the effects of important incentive such as the monetary easing already are still not fully the contribution of the external sector to a benign inflationary scenario may become less at a moment when the effects of investment over productive capacity of the economy still need to in such the monetary authority must remain vigilant to avoid that uncertainties contaminate longer time if the risk profile change and imply shifts in the inflation prospective the committee will promptly adjust the monetary policy stance to the at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on january for technical and on the following to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of september of data analyzed by the copom the increased in down from in october and in totaling increases of in the year through november and in the last twelve food and beverage prices increased in down from in mainly due to the retreat in the prices of milk and its contributing for the headline this effect offset the increases in prices of beans and and in the other it bears emphasizing the acceleration in the prices of up from in and the higher than the headline in the prices of personal outlays and health and personal and in up from and in market prices inflation increased in down from in while regulated prices inflation totaled up from in the same on a trailing market prices increased and regulated among market the prices of goods increased while the prices of tradable goods totaled according to the same comparison the several core inflation measures increased in both on a basis and on a trailing the smoothed trimmed means core rose in up from in in the last twelve the change totaled against in the trimmed means core reached in up from in totaling in the last twelve months through the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached in up from in totaling in the last twelve the increased in up from in totaling in the year through november and in the last twelve considering the three index only the incc decelerated in the increased up from in reaching in the year through november and in twelve the inflation measured by the totaled in up from totaling in the year through november and in the last twelve the incc increased up from in accumulating in the year through november and in the last twelve the higher change of in november was driven by the acceleration in food prices up from in health and personal care up from and clothing up from the core inflation measure increased up from in totaling in the year through november and in the last twelve the acceleration of in november reflected the higher change in agricultural the agricultural ipa elevated up from in while industrial prices increased stable relative to the main drivers for upward agricultural price pressures in november were the prices of corn bovines soy and beans in spite of the higher ipa it is important to highlight the fall in the prices of perishable milk in amongst industrial it bears emphasizing the increase in the prices of fuel oil and moisturized ethylic alcohol and the fall in the prices of activity according to monthly survey retail sales increased seasonally adjusted in among the activities included in the general sales of and food beverages and tobacco expanded on basis as well as furniture and home appliances sales of vehicles and parts and which are not part of the general retail sales decreased in the out of the

increased seasonally while exports grew compared to the first ten months of vehicles production increased in and domestic while exports decreased still according to the production of agricultural machines increased in the same while trucks production grew reflecting the recovery of agricultural income in the current harvest and investments increase in the according to the october estimate for the grains harvest pointed to a increase in compared to national grains production cereals and legumes may reach million due to favorable weather conditions and the incentives stemming from the elevation of international agricultural mainly corn and considering other agricultural in addition to the ibge pointed to a decrease in coffee mainly driven by the biennial periodicity of the and to a increase in sugar cane reflecting the expansion of the planted motivated by the increasing interest in alcohol in the ibge carried out the first prognosis of planted area and production for the

turmoil in financial the us still benefit from the productivity the lack of unbalances in others sectors beyond the real state sector and the still robust labor market which reinforces the resilience of economic activity gdp grew emerging economies continue to present positive economic with highlights for the strong growth observed in a lot of uncertainties still affect the international reflecting the stress provoked by the crisis in the us subprime mortgage with the increasing oil and commodities in addition to the dollar concerns about a less benign scenario for inflation the main central banks maintained interventions through open market operations during the turmoil financial providing short term funding in order to regulate the liquidity and provide an safe and flexible environment concerning the liquidity management in the banking volatility in financial markets remained concerns about inflationary pressures made several central such as south south india and increase their basis interest on the other the federal reserve bank reduced again the fed funds target in its october the central banks in the euro area and japan still keep on waiting the extension of the international financial turmoil to return to their gradual tightening monetary policies foreign trade and international reserves between january and november brazilian external trade continued

billion in with increases of billion in the month and billion in the market and open market operations in the period between the october and december copom the future interest rates especially in longer in the external money inflows for emerging markets reduced and the country risk increased due to two main the recognition of significant losses of us financial institutions related to the crisis in the subprime mortgage market and the increase of risk due to the fear of recession in the us in the domestic strong figures for economic activity and inflation gave support to a steepening of the yield between october and december and rates went up bps and two and rates increased bps and real interest rates measured by the differential between the forward nominal interest rate and the

prices of food and beverages still impacted by domestic and external increased by in october in october and reached in twelve the prices of services rose in september and in and reached in twelve months in october in services inflation still remains at high levels and the pressures in the food and beverages segment are the average of the underlying inflation measures calculated by the bcb has moved from in september to in on its on a trailing the average change of the five core inflation measures moved from in september to in the smoothed trimmed means ipca core inflation moved from in to in while the trimmed means core inflation changed from to in the same the double weight core inflation increased from in september to in at the same core inflation by which excludes ten household food and fuels increased from in september to in and the core inflation by exclusion of regulated prices and household food changed from in september to in inflation measured by the general price index decreased in after increasing by in on a trailing in inflation in october the main component of this the wholesale price index changed in the twelve months through influenced by strong increase in the agricultural sector which on its impacted by supply according to the breakdown by stage of there were increases in the prices of raw materials intermediate goods and final goods according to the same comparison inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the stood at in the twelve months through october in october the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the changed in twelve partially driven by the increase in labor on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in september in and in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the behavior of wholesale prices on consumer inflation will depend on the current and prospective demand conditions and on the price expectations regarding the future inflation the economic activity index of the bcb incorporates estimates for the monthly production of the three sectors of the as well as for taxes on and constitutes important coincident indicator of economic considering seasonally adjusted the decreased by in after increasing by in as a the indicator increased in the third and the accumulated growth stood at in on its the consumer confidence index from the getúlio vargas foundation retreated in although it stands above the recent historical average of the on the other the services sector confidence index registered the third consecutive increase in still according to the the industry confidence index retreated in according to the seasonally adjusted after three consecutive monthly according to survey carried out by the grains production should grow by this for projections point to industrial activity retreated by in after expanding by three consecutive according to the series seasonally adjusted by the industrial production decreased in of the branches of industrial production fell in september and on a accumulated despite the growth in the third quarter this according to the national confederation of industry real revenues in the manufacturing industry decreased by in and the number of hours worked retreated by as a real revenues grew by between january and and the number of hours worked decreased by among the industry use according to data seasonally adjusted by the the production of durable consumer goods decreased by in after three months of positive the of and nondurable consumer goods stood stable in while the production of capital goods and intermediate goods retreated and regarding the accumulated growth through there were decreases in the production of durable consumer goods and consumer goods capital goods and intermediate goods the unemployment rate for the six metropolitan areas covered by the monthly employment survey without seasonal was estimated at below the rate recorded in october according to the series seasonally adjusted by the the unemployment rate changed from in september to in the occupation level which represents the share of occupied people relative to the share of people at working age reached a record high for the series in october still according to the the average real income rose in on its real payroll increased compared to october data released by the ministry of labor and employment show in thousand formal jobs were created thousand in october the sectors that contributed the most to this in absolute were trade and in the set of available data indicates a heated labor although with some signs of moderation at the according to the retail monthly survey from retail sales volume increased in and broad retail sales increased according to the same comparison retail sales expanded by in according to the seasonally adjusted and broad retail sales fell by partially due to the reversion of which happened in and which stemmed from fiscal stimuli to the vehicles as a the broad retail sales growth accumulated in the twelve months through september stood at in with expansion in all ten sectors with highlights for computer and communication material and equipment and furniture and appliances the trade confidence index measured by the increased for the third consecutive month in with improvement in the perception of current situation and in for the upcoming the retail sales trajectory will continue to be influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll growth and by moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal slightly retreated in november to standing above the level observed in november according to the seasonally adjusted series calculated by the the nuci stood at in above the level recorded in november and below the record high of the series recorded in june capacity utilization intensified in the consumer goods sector throughout the last and reached in in the sectors of capital intermediate goods and construction the levels stood at and the trade balance on a accumulated basis retreated to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in associated to changes of and compared to the previous twelve on its the current account deficit in the same period reached billion in equivalent to of while foreign direct investment totaled billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of surpassing the need for external global economy faces a period of with prospects of low growth for a prolonged despite the recent accommodation in the volatility and risk aversion high unemployment rates for a long coupled with the implementation of fiscal the limited space for countercyclical actions and political uncertainties are translated into projections of low growth for mature mainly in the compound leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development related to indicates stabilization in the growth of the united states and china and some deterioration in the euro area and in the disaggregated indicators of the purchasing managers index for as well as the preliminary results for suggest moderate global mainly in the manufacturing despite signaling growth in the us and in the main emerging regarding monetary advanced economies persist with strongly accommodative core inflation measures have remained at moderate levels in the in the area and in in emerging in the monetary policy bias is which in some with other countercyclical the price of brent oil barrel has remained above it bears highlighting that the even higher geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment as measured by the commodity research bureau since the last copom international prices of metallic commodities have remained while those of agricultural commodities have retreated relative to the record highs observed in april the changes reached and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations accumulates a fall of until compared to the peak recorded in february in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was influenced by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and to volatility in fx assessment of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for for was maintained at the same value considered at the october copom the projected adjustment for for was maintained at the same value considered at the october copom the projected adjustment for for bottled for increased to up from considered at the october copom the projected adjustment for fixed telephone for was reduced to down from considered at the october copom the projected based on individual for the set of regulated prices inflation accumulated in was reduced to down from considered at the october copom and the projected adjustment for the set of regulated prices accumulated in was maintained at the same value considered at the october copom for the projection is these projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices and the inflation measured by the igp price the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline estimates bps and bps spreads for the fourth quarter of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus around of with as a working a primary surplus around of gdp for without is according to parameters set out in the budget guidelines law for as a working a primary surplus of of gdp is without the set of projections incorporates the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca increased from to for the median of inflation expectations decreased from to specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed from and to and for the median changed from and to and in the same the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the october copom meeting and stands above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast increased and stands above the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection remained stable in both scenarios also above the midpoint target in both for the inflation forecast is around the midpoint inflation target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the copom also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investments and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those deriving from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic in this despite identifying a decrease in the probability of occurrence of extreme events in international financial the copom considers that the external environment remains the copom understands the prospects of moderate global activity have remained it also notes in mature there seems to be limited leeway for monetary policy and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming on the other in important emerging the pace of activity has supported by the resilience of domestic the copom also highlights the evidences of moderation of localized price pressures in agricultural commodities which had arisen between the second and third quarters of the year and were a consequence of an unfavorable supply the copom considers that the prospects for domestic economic activity are in this and in the upcoming with some asymmetry among the several this assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit both for individuals and and by the fact that the confidence in a lower the stand at a high the committee that the domestic activity will continue to be favored by public as well as by labor market which is reflected in historically low unemployment rates and in wage despite some accommodation at the the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it is noteworthy that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the working hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatch between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public ratio and the positive perception regarding the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom emphasizes that its main scenario includes prospects for stronger economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters and limited risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the labor despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the copom emphasizes that the outlook for the upcoming semesters indicates moderation in the price dynamics of some real and financial under the evidences such as the accommodation of wholesale prices indicate the cooling of pressures on consumer resulting from the instability in the prices of in natura products and grains observed in the last in the copom considers that the prospective scenario for inflation shows favorable signs and reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve months tends to move towards the target even in a in this the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes carlos hamilton vasconcelos luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson feltrim and sidnei corrêa the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially regarding household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and for the these the programs of public services concession and the gradual recovery of confidence create good prospects for investment in this and in the upcoming the committee considers that recent initiatives indicate the balance of the public sector moving from a position of neutrality to on the other the committee notes that the fragile international scenario represents an important factor restraining aggregate these elements and the developments in the quasi fiscal field and in the assets market are important parts of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of

although the risk associated with economic slack has increased at the the balance of risks is discussion about the conduct of monetary committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in

worth noting in addition to the shocks already uncertainties about fundamental aspects of the future economic environment notably fiscal sustainability have adverse effects on economic in uncertainty

for deep adjustments in the brazilian notably those of fiscal they concluded that the persistence of uncertainties regarding fiscal sustainability tend to be reforms that lead to sustainability of fiscal policy have expansionary which can offset the effects of fiscal adjustment on economic in addition to mitigating the risks of bouts of instability with increased risk as witnessed in committee

is risk of additional impact on emerging economies owing to this which may reinforce changes in asset prices and in the volatility of financial conditions in international the committee members also mentioned the growing risks to value obtained according to the usual procedure of rounding the average exchange rate observed on the five business days ending on the friday prior to the copom bank of

price changes in a context of anchored inflation expectations may contribute to the convergence of inflation to without posing risks to its favorable dynamics once these price changes are the members considered that the evolution of the prospective inflation path in the medium and long terms along with the anchoring of inflation expectations should be monitored in order to evaluate possible more enduring effects from shocks both those that have already occurred and those that may yet arise on inflation their the committee reaffirmed the understanding with anchored inflation in the face of occasional shocks that lead to changes in relative monetary policy should focus on their round effects the copom also highlighted that its reaction to possible changes in relative prices will be monetary policy will follow the same whether in the face of inflationary shocks in the case of an external shock leading to a depreciation of the exchange or in the face of disinflationary shocks in the case of a favorable food price the committee emphasizes that this prescription requires an environment with anchored established how monetary policy should react to shocks that induce changes in

of the halt in the transportation it was agreed that these effects are revealing themselves they discussed possible more enduring effects of the shocks faced by the brazilian this context reinforces the importance of monitoring over time the evolution of the baseline scenario and its risks and of evaluating the duration of the effects of shocks on inflation its in order to ensure that the achievement of low inflation even in the face of adverse regarding the balance of on the one the committee judged that downward risks for the prospective inflation path due to the low level of

while the forecast for stands around under the market the forecast for remained essentially unchanged at around and the forecast for increased to around both above the inflation target for these two calendar of risks around baseline inflation scenario the recent brazilian with a prolonged period of high inflation and may still reinforce inertial there are signs of a recent pause in the disinflation process of ipca components that are most sensitive to the business cycle and to monetary which might signal slower convergence of inflation to in this greater inflationary persistence requires greater monetary policy on the other the continuous softening of the labor market and the significant deceleration of economic activity in produce faster disinflation for in the services sector than the one reflected in the inflation expectations measured by the focus survey and in the conditional projections produced by the the process of approval and implementation of the necessary adjustments in the including those of fiscal presents itself as central do brasil copom meeting a risk and an opportunity for the ongoing disinflationary the first steps in this process have been which may suggest greater timeliness and probability of on the other the process is long and involves the reduction of uncertainty would enhance the effects of monetary discussion about the conduct of monetary policy the committee members discussed the evolution of economic activity in the short in the light of the most recent and agreed that indicators for august came in below nevertheless they reasoned that such fluctuations tend to take place during stabilization in after an economic contraction such as the one experienced in the last two it is likely that the stabilization process involve significant fluctuations at this stage of the business in this the committee members agreed that the available evidence is consistent with recent stabilization of the brazilian economy and a possible gradual recovery of economic regarding the international the members of the committee pointed out the continuation of a relatively benign environment for emerging uncertainties regarding the process of normalization of monetary policy in the united states all committee members agreed on the need to monitor the pace of monetary policy normalization in the united states and its possible implications for the brazilian there was also consensus on the continuation of the and risks in the external associated with the fragility of global economic the committee analyzed its conditional forecasts for inflation in different the copom concluded that the evolution of the forecasts in the reference scenario over the relevant which covers the calendar years and indicate that there is room for a gradual and moderate easing of monetary on the other forecasts under the market scenario suggest that there are limits to the magnitude of easing in the same the members of the monetary policy committee pointed out besides the analysis of conditional inflation the favorable evolution of the factors emphasized by the copom in its august statement leaves for the beginning of a process of gradual and moderate easing of monetary regarding current the committee members mentioned the favorable results in the short run and the drop in forecasts for the transmission process of declining food prices from the wholesale into the retail sector seems to have and there is no evidence of secondround effects of the shock on other prices in the inflation forecasts for as measured by the focus have retreated in a way that is compatible with this the conditional forecasts for inflation produced by the copom assume a path for regulated prices that is close to the one used in the latest a number of factors may lead to changes in these in the committee members the recently announced change in fuel price evidence of reductions in electricity prices in some possibility of postponement of increases in public transportation fares in some risk of hikes in electricity prices above expectations for due among other changes in base rates for the copom analyzed service price inflation and its the committee members highlighted the progress obtained in the disinflation process of this ipca regarding recent the committee members argued to some the recent fall owes to the reversion of earlier movements in more volatile and to the evolution of components that are sensitive to the recent food price considering different measures with items that are more sensitive to the business cycle and to monetary the committee members concluded that there are signs of a recent pause in the disinflationary process that had been observed in these after accounting for seasonal they also noted that this pause occurs at a level if would produce disinflation at a slower pace than the one assumed in the baseline this scenario assumes a gradual disinflation path going as a the committee members highlighted the need to monitor the resumption of this all members of the committee recognized the progress and the efforts for approval and implementation of adjustments in the especially with regard to fiscal the committee members emphasized that these efforts are crucial for the stabilization and the development of the brazilian the committee should monitor these efforts since they have important implications for the disinflation all committee members central do brasil copom meeting that the process of consideration of the proposed reforms has been faster than the long and uncertain nature of the process suggests that there at the same risk and all members agreed that the implications of the adjustment process in the economy for inflation dynamics depend not only on the impact of short term measures on aggregate but also on the perception of improved dynamics of public finances in the medium and long the committee reaffirmed its goal of conducting monetary policy in order to achieve the inflation target in the relevant which encompasses the calendar years and in this the copom understands that the pace of monetary easing will be always taking into account its inflation forecasts and its determinant in order to pursue a trajectory that complies with the inflation target for and the committee judges that currently there is no incompatibility between these two the committee believes in presenting its conditional forecasts for inflation and emphasizing factors that can allow greater confidence in meeting the inflation it increases strengthens its communication and enhances the effects of monetary in this the copom members also discussed the implications of spelling out economic conditionalities for the pace and magnitude of the monetary easing just the committee concluded that conditioning the future evolution of monetary policy on factors that matter for inflation can better transmit the economic rationality that guides the monetary policy decision taking into account the baseline the balance of risks and the wide array of available the copom unanimously decided to reduce the selic rate to without the committee judges that convergence of inflation to the and target is compatible with a moderate and gradual easing of monetary the committee will assess the pace and magnitude of monetary easing over in order to ensure convergence of inflation to the the magnitude of monetary easing and a possible speeding up of its pace will depend on a evolution of factors that allow greater confidence in meeting the inflation targets at the relevant horizon for the conduct of monetary which includes and the committee emphasizes the following domestic that disinflation of ipca components that are most sensitive to monetary policy and economic slack resumes clearly and at an appropriate and that the pace of approval and implementation of the necessary economic adjustments contribute to inflation dynamics that are compatible with inflation converging to the committee will assess the evolution of the combination of such the following members of the committee voted for this ilan goldfajn anthero de moraes carlos viana de isaac

tradable goods increased in twelve months through july in july and the prices of in july it bears noticing that the prices of the food and beverages group increased in twelve months through july in july and the prices of services rose in july in available information suggests some persistence of which partially reflects the dynamics of prices in the services sector in the short the realignment

in twelve months in july with increases of in the prices of agricultural products and in the prices of industrial inflation measured by the consumer price index the second most important component of the changed in twelve months through july in july the civil construction national index component with the lowest weight in the increased in july partially driven by pressures stemming from labor which changed in the on its the industry price index calculated by the brazilian institute of geography and statistics increased in changing in twelve the copom considers that the effects of the

prospects in line with the trend in important advanced and emerging particularly about despite recent monetary policy high unemployment coupled with the fiscal consolidation and political constitute elements restraining investments and regarding the monetary in accommodative stances prevail in advanced and emerging despite the current advances in the debate on the normalization of monetary the inflation rates remain at low levels in the advanced in the emerging they stand at relatively high the price of the brent oil barrel fell to levels around since the previous copom to levels near it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of this volatile behavior also reflects the low predictability of some global demand and supply since the last copom the international prices of agricultural and metal commodities have fallen and on its the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fell in the twelve months through july of inflation trends the identified and their were reassessed according to the new set of available for the set of regulated prices the projected adjustment is in up from considered at the july copom among other this projection considers the assumption of changes of in the price of gasoline and in the price of bottled in fixed telephone tariffs and of in electricity the items for which there are more information available were projected individually for the projections are based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal market prices inflation and the igp price based on these the projected regulated prices change is for unchanged relative to the july committee the estimate path for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the baseline projects basis points and bps for the fourth quarters of and the structural primary surplus is considered as the fiscal it derives from the primary surplus trajectories set at of the gdp for and of the gdp for it also bears emphasizing in a given the fiscal impulse corresponds to the variation of the structural surplus in comparison to the observed in the previous since the last copom the median of the projections compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca changed from to for from to the baseline scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation compared to the value considered at the previous copom meeting and remains above the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the market expectations for the exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by in the period immediately prior to the copom the ipca inflation forecast also increased relative to the value considered at the july meeting and remains above the inflation for according to the baseline the inflation projection and stands around the inflation target set by the according to the market the inflation forecast remained stable and above the inflation policy decision the copom emphasizes that the international which is ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates generate distortions that lead to higher risks and depress these distortions are for in the shortening of the planning horizons of companies and as well as in the deterioration of the businessmen the committee also emphasizes that high inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of wages and with negative repercussions over the confidence and as a high inflation rates reduce the potential of economic as well as of jobs and income in view of the copom evaluates that the monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly prices it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to in a more the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other macroeconomic policy actions may influence the prices it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer the copom considers since its last the risks to global financial stability have remained such as those derived from changes in the yield curve slope of major advanced despite identifying low probability of occurrence of extreme events in the international financial the committee considers that the external environment remains with episodes of higher volatility affecting important emerging for the the trend for global activity showed more moderation throughout the monetary policy relevant the prospects have continued indicating activity recovery in some advanced economies and acceleration in the pace of growth in in the room to use monetary policy in these economies remains limited and a fiscal restraint scenario important emerging economies experience a transition period of moderation in the activity despite the resilience of the domestic still regarding international financial the copom highlights evidence of new sources of volatility in the currency and fixed income markets and moderation in the dynamics of commodities regarding the committee highlights regardless of the behavior of the domestic prices of the evolution of international prices tends to be transmitted to the domestic economy both through productive such as the and through inflation the copom reaffirms in accordance to the macroeconomic adjustment process the available indicators show that the domestic absorption and gdp growth rates continued to adjust and confirm that the domestic activity expansion pace this year will be lower than the this process is being intensified by the uncertainties arising from the effect of in the investment has mainly influenced by the occurrence of these and private consumption shows contraction in line with recent data regarding employment and for the after a necessary period of which may be more intense and longer than the activity expansion pace tends to as and confidence the committee evaluates in the medium important changes should take place in the composition of aggregate supply and consumption tends to grow at a moderate pace and investments tend to gain these coupled with other ones currently anticipate a composition for aggregate demand growth in the medium term more favorable to potential regarding the external component of aggregate the scenario of higher global combined with the depreciation of the contributes to make this component more favorable to the brazilian economy regarding the supply the committee evaluates in longer more favorable prospects for the competitiveness of industry and agriculture have the services on its tends to grow at rates lower than those recorded over the recent for the it is plausible to claim that these developments coupled with advances in terms of qualification of the labor force and with the program of public services concession will be reflected in a more efficient allocation of the production factors of the economy and in productivity the copom observes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal relative to the structural fiscal result and depending on the economic the committee considers during the relevant horizon for the monetary the balance of the public sector tends to shift to the neutral and does not rule out the hypothesis of migration to the fiscal restraint even if more slowly and with lower the prospects for a new change in the trajectories regarding fiscal implicit in the budget proposal for affected the expectations the asset in this the committee notes that significant changes in the trajectory of primary surpluses generation impact the working hypotheses considered for inflation projections and contribute to create a less positive perception of the macroeconomic environment in the medium and long it also highlights that a primary path that strengthens the perception of sustainability of the public sector balance contributes to reduce the public debt financing with favorable impact on the cost of capital in general at stimulating private investment in the medium and long specifically regarding inflation the committee highlights that the literature and the best international practices recommend a consistent and sustainable fiscal policy in order to allow monetary policy actions to be fully transmitted to the copom highlights that the main scenario also considers moderate credit which had already been observed and tends to regarding this it is important to highlight the fact after years of strong the consumer credit has so over the last it was possible to on the one exposure reduction by on the other deleveraging of the in the it can be inferred that the risks in the consumer credit segment have been in another as illustrated by actions that were the committee as opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating concessions of subsidies through credit regarding the as anticipated by previous the copom observes that the idleness margin in the labor market has increased at a faster with data confirming the acceleration of a process of distension in this a significant risk still prevails to the possibility of concession of increases incompatible with productivity with negative impacts over in spite of the occurrence of real wage changes more consistent with the gains estimates for the labor the committee evaluates that the wages dynamics remains originating inflationary cost for the the fact that inflation currently stands at high levels in large the occurrence of two important relative prices adjustment processes underway in the economy the realignment of domestic prices relative to international prices and the realignment of regulated prices relative to market the committee also considers over the first half of among other these relative prices ajustments in the among other have made the balance of risks to inflation unfavorable this in this as anticipated in previous these price adjustments cause inflation to rise in the short term and to tend to remain high in requiring determination and perseverance to prevent its transmission to longer while recognizing that these relative prices adjustments have direct impacts over the committee reaffirms its view that the monetary policy should and is containing the second order effects stemming from in order to limit them to given the assessing the macroeconomic the inflation prospects and the current balance of the copom unanimously decided to maintain the selic rate at without the committee understands that maintaining this level of the basic interest for a sufficiently long is necessary for the convergence of inflation to the target at the end of the following members of the committee voted for this alexandre antonio tombini aldo luiz altamir anthero de moraes luiz awazu pereira da luiz edson otávio ribeiro sidnei corrêa marques and tony the copom reaffirms that the aggregate demand will continue to be moderate in the relevant horizon for the monetary on the one household consumption tends to be influenced by factors such as income and on the other the real state the concession of public services and the expansion of agricultural among other tend to benefit on its exports tend to be benefited by the scenario of higher growth of major trading partners and by the depreciation of the which has started to result in better outcomes for the external for the the combined effects of these the developments in the quasi fiscal framework and in the assets market this the recovery dynamics of regulated prices are important factors in the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the convergence of inflation to the target established by at the end of in this the copom believes that the convergence scenario of inflation to at the end of has been despite some deterioration in the balance of for the on the one the progress made in the fight against inflation like benign signals stemming from the medium and long term expectations indicators show that the monetary policy strategy is in the right under this some remaining risks for the inflation forecasts to reach safely the goal of at the end of are consistent with the lagged and cumulative effect of monetary policy on the other recent increases in the risk which reflect in the prices of require that the monetary policy is vigilant in case of significant deviations of inflation forecasts from the at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on october for the technical and on the following to deliberate on monetary as established in the communiqué of june after rising to in ipca inflation fell in february to confirming that the inflation increase at the start of the year was mainly due to seasonal and as anticipated in the last copom in ipca was virtually unchanged at for a change in the first quarter of the compared to in the same period of trailing ipca inflation decreased from in january to in the lowest rate since june this decline partially reflects the favorable behavior of household food which fell in the and took place despite pressures stemming from transportation in alcohol fuel prices rose in the quarter solely in and contributed for inflation in the ipca inflation is expected to decelerate again in reflecting the depletion of factors that pressured prices in the first as well as the seasonal decline in food as stressed in the last and in previous the inflation scenario for is more benign than that observed in with favorable prospects for compliance with the target set by the national monetary council all ipca core inflation measures fell in the similarly to the headline core inflation by exclusion of household food items and regulated prices fell to in down from in february and in averaging in the smoothed trimmed means core fell to in down from in february and in averaging in the trimmed means core fell to in down from in february and in averaging in the both trimmed means cores were stable relative to the previous while the core by exclusion more than doubled in the trailing inflation cores reached and for the three measures only the trimmed means stood below the headline after a rise in the general price index declined to in february and in for a change in the compared to in the same period of on a twelvemonth trailing stands at the lowest figure for the series as measured since the wholesale price component was the main driver of the registering and changes in february and the contraction was mainly caused by the fall in agricultural especially in march reflecting sharp price decreases of products with large weight in the such as corn and on a trailing the and the agricultural ipa reached and while industrial ipa rose there are consistent signs of accommodation in wholesale price with potential positive spillover effects on consumer prices in the coming even though some trend reversion is likely to reflecting the pressures of international commodities as emphasized in recent copom the continuity and strength of this will depend on demand conditions and expectations for the future inflation after resuming growth in the last quarter of following a weak performance in the third quarter industrial output fell a seasonally adjusted in but grew in on the same according to data from the brazilian institute of geography and statistics in industrial output expanded by versus the same month last growing for the fifth consecutive in the period through industrial output grew compared to the same period of and seasonally on a moving average industrial output grew for the third month in a row industrial output recovery was broadly due to the lagged effects of the monetary easing implemented since september and as a consequence of inventories reduction in the second half of as a industrial output in is expected to outperform growth leading and coincident indicators suggest industrial output will contract in march on a moving average this does not contradict the recovery marked by volatility around a clear growth disaggregated industrial data show divergent performances in intermediate goods output increased while capital goods output decreased seasonally of the capital goods contraction in january followed sharp consecutive rises in november and december and in only intermediate goods production contracted while consumer and capital goods increased and for both the moving average series showed increases for all use similarly to in the twelve months through capital goods production grew while consumer goods production increased with highlights for durable which grew outperforming the average industrial labor market has sustained a positive notwithstanding the unemployment rate measured by ibge in compared to in despite the recent attributable to seasonal unemployment rates at the start of were substantially lower than those recorded in the same months of the number of employed persons increased by in the twelve months through while workers unemployed for a period between and months and for over year diminished and after declining in real earnings increased in standing above february partially reflecting the positive effects of lower inflation on real according to the national industry confederation manufacturing employment rose in the first two months of versus the same period of evidencing the trend that associates more jobs with higher real formal employment measured by ministry of labor and employment accelerated at the start of growing a seasonally adjusted in with thousand jobs for thousand new positions in the ibge seasonally adjusted data recorded a increase in retail sales for january the fourth consecutive rise followed by a decrease in when compared to the same months of january and february sales expanded and quarterly moving less influenced by seasonal indicate growth rates of in january and in for a growth in the threemonth period to this performance not only reflects the expansion of more and employmentsensitive but also mirrors the favorable dynamics of the favorable outlook for retail sales in is supported by positive labor market credit expansion and the monetary easing in addition to the recovery in consumer confidence and the expansionary impacts of the minimum wage installed capacity utilization in the manufacturing industry slightly declined to in as against in december and roughly below the levels registered in the beginning of according to cni data seasonally adjusted by the this decline takes place together with mounting fixed capital in the first two months of versus the same period of capital goods absorption expanded by mainly driven by the increase in capital goods imports volume while civil construction inputs expanded by despite favorable prospects for aggregate demand expansion in the coming relevant supply unbalances are not as stressed in previous inflation trend is closely linked to current and prospective developments with regard to the expansion of supply to adequately meet demand recent data confirm the strong performance of external trade at the start of and the copom evaluates that external demand will continue to play an important role in economic activity in trailing exports reached or billion solely in the exceeding by march which have also reached billion in up compared to the same month of last the trailing trade surplus has continued to increase and reached a record high in march a reduction in the trade surplus would not though a still robust result is after registering a million deficit in attributable to unusual profits and dividends the current account surplus stood at million in february and billion in for a billion surplus in the twelve months through or of international financial market liquidity conditions have continued to positively influence the domestic economic as mentioned in the last despite still some deterioration in international financial markets have been basically due to three uncertainties regarding the length of the monetary policy tightening in the interest rate increases in the euro and the prospects for monetary policy in the continuous improvement of domestic macroeconomic reflected on the continued significant trade accumulation of international adequate public primary improved public debt profile and buyback of external has strengthened the domestic resilience to the improvement in domestic resilience to shocks reflected not only the reduction in brazilian country which fell below basis points in january since has averaged below basis but also the evidence that the domestic economy has sustained the growth trend despite the long monetary adjustment process in course in the on the one the start of a more restrictive monetary policy cycle in japan tends to decrease international on the other it indicates that the second largest world economy is recovering its economic with positive spillovers for international trade and for a more balanced world the copom continues to assign a low probability to a significant deterioration in international financial market conditions that could affect brazilian external the main concern regarding the international scenario is the hike in oil which lately reached record the recent increase reinforces the concern that oil prices may reach more elevated peak levels than previously assessed in the most likely and even after an eventual reversal in they may resist at levels above the as in previous the future oil prices trajectory still encompasses great for this the copom maintains a scenario in which there is no change to domestic gasoline prices in this scenario finds support in assessments that underscore speculative key elements in recent oil price which could retrocede even in light of the increasing key geopolitical it should be recognized that since the last copom meeting this scenario became less likely and the related to its materialization increased in apart from the effects of an increase in domestic fuel the elevation in international oil prices affects the domestic economy through productive such as the as well as through the deterioration of market inflation assessment of inflation trends the inflation shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to newly available the scenario considered in the simulations utilized the following the projection for gasoline and bottled gas prices adjustments in remained unchanged at the projection for fixed line telephone and household electricity adjustments in also remained at and for all regulated the copom maintained the adjustment projection for these according to the weights released by the ibge in represent of the total the projection for regulated prices inflation in based on the endogenous determination remained at this model considers the effects of seasonal of the exchange of market prices inflation and of the the projection for the spread over the selic using a vector autoregressive model based on the selic and swap rates on the eve of the increased from an average of basis points in the second quarter of to basis points in the last quarter of and basis points in the last quarter of regarding fiscal it is assumed that the consolidated public sector primary surplus target of of gdp in and will be the related assumptions considered in the previous meeting were since the march median ipca inflation expectations for compiled by the investors relations group decreased to from this reduction was mainly driven by the downward revision of market inflation expectations for the second ahead inflation expectations presented more significant to from for inflation expectations remained in line with the target established by the as mentioned in previous these developments suggest that the recent monetary policy stance has both contained inflationary pressures and contributed to the consolidation of a more favorable macroeconomic the inflation forecast under the benchmark scenario which assumes the maintenance of the selic rate at and the exchange rate at during the forecast period decreased relative to the forecast presented in the march remaining below the target for the the forecast based on the market scenario which incorporates the consensus exchange rate and selic rate trajectories collected by gerin on the eve of the meeting slightly declined relative to the march standing around the target for the for the benchmark forecast slightly increased compared to but remained below the inflation on the other the forecast under the market scenario remained virtually and above the inflation monetary policy decision the copom reaffirms the view that current and expected inflation demonstrate that the monetary stance adopted since september has both contained inflationary pressures and consolidated a more favorable macroeconomic economic activity has recovered momentum at a pace consistent with supply such that it will not trigger significant inflationary in despite continued volatility in international financial markets due to uncertainties regarding the monetary policy in developed countries and the record highs reached by oil the external outlook remains particularly with regard to brazilian external financing a benign inflation environment continues to the likely reversal of favorable factors that subdued and the increased risk stemming from important commodity as in the march the committee emphasizes that the main challenge for monetary policy is to ensure the consolidation of these favorable the uninterrupted convergence of inflation to the target path and the resulting consolidation of a long lasting macroeconomic stability will contribute to the progressive reduction in perceived macroeconomic a process already underway for several the scope for a reduction in real interest rates in the future will naturally the committee considers that its cautionary monetary policy stance has been critical to increasing the probability of inflation convergence to the target for this to it is important that inflation indicators remain consistent with the recent benign inflation copom emphasizes that there are important lags in monetary policy transmission to economic activity and since the start of the monetary easing in september the committee has reduced the selic rate by basis the activity level has not completely mirrored the effects of the interest rates as well as the effects of the recent activity resumption on inflation have not completely in the coming employment and income expansions and credit growth will continue to sustain economic as mentioned in the march activity level should also reflect the effects of the new minimum wage and the fiscal impulse of the last quarter of and first half of the effects of interest rates cuts will add up to other factors that will contribute to demand given the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission and the reduced difference between the current selic rate and the equilibrium the copom understood that the maintenance of important achievements in disinflation and in preserving economic with job creation and rising real may demand a more cautious monetary easing this argument is even more relevant in light of the fact that the monetary policy decisions in the coming months will produce concentrated impacts for the unanimously decided to continue the monetary easing process begun in the september reducing the selic target rate to without and closely follow the evolution of the macroeconomic scenario until its next at which time it will define the next steps in its monetary policy at the conclusion of the it was announced that the copom would reconvene on may for technical and on the following day to discuss the monetary policy as established in communiqué of october of data analyzed by the copom inflation the ipca increased to in virtually unchanged compared to the previous factors ware again responsible for the bulk of the monthly fuel alcohol prices and its direct impact on gasoline prices contributed for the ipca on the other food prices maintained the downward trend begun in and declined the ipca rose by in the first and in the last twelve regulated prices grew in march and in the last twelve while market prices increased by and in the same the gap between these two categories is mainly attributable to fuel which increased in twelve tradable and prices increased and in and and in the last twelve in the declined for changes of in the first quarter of and in twelve the lowest figure for the series as measured since among its the increased to in favored by the continued downward trend of food which decreased a decline in the incc increased by compared to in the the with the largest weight in the fell after a decline in for changes of in the year and in the twelve months through the fall in wholesale prices was mainly due to the sharp decline in agricultural the agricultural ipa dipped to in march from in mainly driven by the decreases in the prices of manioc and industrial prices were largely posting a compared to in according to the processing only final goods prices despite a slight deceleration down from in intermediate goods and raw material prices decreased again in recording and after and in the previous all ipca core inflation measures declined in the core under the smoothed trimmed means method stood at compared to in for a rise in twelve the trimmed means core decreased to down from in for a expansion in twelve the core excluding household food and regulated prices reached down from in the previous for a expansion in twelve the core calculated by the fgv under the symmetric trimmed means reached in march down from in for expansions of in the year and in the last twelve the ipca

influenced by governmental by the pace of real payroll by the improvement in the consumer confidence level and by moderate credit the installed capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing calculated by the without seasonal moved from in february to in below the level observed in march according to the seasonally adjusted monthly series calculated by the the nuci stood at in march below

at in it is noticing that the difference between the proportion of companies that reported excess inventories and those which reported insufficient inventories fell in march for the third consecutive the trade balance surplus on a accumulated basis increased from billion in february to billion in this result stemmed from billion in exports and billion in equivalent to and in the last twelve months through the current account deficit accumulated in twelve months changed from billion in january to billion in equivalent to of on its foreign direct investment reached billion in the twelve months through equivalent to of global economy continues to face a period of despite some stability in the risk aversion and with prospects of low since the last copom a more positive perception about the activity in the united states and japan has but such as the ones related to the oil price and to the scenario of fiscal the unlimited provision of liquidity by the european central bank reduced the probability of occurrence of extreme but elevated risks to global financial stability among other due to international banks exposure to sovereign debts of countries with fiscal high persistent unemployment coupled with the need for fiscal the limited scope for anticyclical policy actions and the political have contributed for projections of low growth in mature despite the heterogeneity among in both the composite leading indicator released by the organization for economic cooperation and development for and the disaggregate indicators of purchasing managers index for point to fragile activity in the euro at the same activity in china decelerated in the first and recorded the lowest growth rate since the first quarter of regarding monetary mature economies have persisted with strongly accommodative monetary stances in some with policy despite this inflation core measures have continued at moderate levels both in the us and in the euro area and considering the relatively moderate prospects for the activity in emerging in the monetary policy bias is the price of brent oil barrel remained above in political instability in important producing countries and lags in the process of production it bears highlighting that the geopolitical complexity that involves the oil sector tends to heighten the volatile behavior of which is also a reflex of the low predictability of some global demand components and of the dependency of supply growth on long term risky investment regarding the other it is noteworthy the downward movement for agricultural and metal international prices since the last copom with respective decreases of and as measured by the commodity research bureau compared to the peak recorded in april the cumulative decline in both categories stands at and the food price calculated by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations which considers accumulates a fall of until since the peak observed in february in the recent the high volatility observed for the commodities prices was strongly impacted by the abundant global in a context where financial markets adjust to new expectations for growth and volatility in fx it is plausible to affirm that the chinese announcement of reduced growth targets tends to generate some impact on commodities of inflation trends the identified shocks and their impacts were reassessed according to the new set of available the scenario considered in the simulations was based on the following the projected adjustment for gasoline and bottled gas for were maintained at the same value considered at the march the projected adjustments for for fixed telephone was maintained at the same value considered at the march while the electricity projection was decreased to down from considered at the march the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in based on individual according to the benchmark was maintained at the same value considered at the march the projection for regulated prices inflation accumulated in according to the benchmark remained at the same value considered at the march copom such projection is based on endogenous determination models for regulated which among other seasonal foreign exchange rate market prices inflation and the igp price and the projection for the spreads over the selic based on the swap on the benchmark estimates bps and bps spreads in the fourth quarters of and regarding fiscal projections assume the achievement in of the public sector primary surplus target around of without according to the parameters contained in the budget guidelines law it is accepted as a working a primary surplus of billion for around of without according to parameters set out in draft budget guidelines law for it is accepted as a working hypothesis a primary surplus of of without the set of projections incorporated the estimated effects of the reduction in the neutral interest rate identified over the last as a working the main scenario also considers that the current deterioration in the international scenario will have an impact on the brazilian economy equivalent to one fourth of the impact observed during the international it is noteworthy that part of this estimated impact is already being observed in the most recent economic activity since the last copom the median of the expectations compiled by the investor relations and special studies department for the ipca decreased to from for the median of inflation expectations increased to from specifically for asset managers and other institutions sector consultancies and the median of expectations for the ipca changed to and from and for the median changed to and from and in the same the benchmark scenario assumes the maintenance of the exchange rate at and the selic rate at during the forecast under this the projection for the inflation increased relative to the figure considered at the march copom and it stands around the midpoint target established by the national monetary council according to the market which incorporates the consensus exchange and selic rates trajectories collected by gerin in the period immediately prior to the copom ipca inflation forecast for also increased and stands around the midpoint inflation for the inflation projection rose in the reference scenario and remained stable in the market standing above the midpoint target in both policy decision the copom evaluates that monetary policy should contribute to the consolidation of a favorable macroeconomic in this the copom reassures under the inflation targeting it guides its decisions according to bcb projected inflation and based on the analysis of alternative scenarios for the evolution of the main variables that determine prices the committee also understands that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to reduce uncertainties regarding the future behavior of headline facilitate the assessment of scenarios by the monetary as well as help the process of coordination of economic particularly price it is noteworthy that low risks for the underlying inflation in the short run tend to intensify the effects of monetary policy enabling them to affect in a more manner the dynamics of headline inflation in the although the copom recognizes that other actions of macroeconomic policy may influence the price it reaffirms its view that it is particularly under the responsibility of the monetary policy to remain especially vigilant to guarantee that pressures detected in shorter horizons do not spread to longer international ratified by the brazilian indicates that high inflation rates lead to the increase in risk both for private and public and to the shortening of planning both for households and high inflation rates reduce investment and economic growth in addition to presenting regressive effects on income in other high inflation rates do not originate any lasting results for economic and employment on the they create permanent damage to these variables in the medium and long the strategy adopted by the copom aims to ensure the convergence of inflation towards the targets which requires that possible deviations from the target path be promptly such strategy takes into account the time lags in the transmission mechanism and is the most adequate to deal with the uncertainty inherent to the process of monetary policy formulation and the copom considers since the last the risks to global financial stability have remained particularly those deriving from the ongoing deleveraging process observed in the main economic the committee understands in the restrictions to which several mature economies were exposed have changed it also notes in these there seems to be limited scope for using monetary and a scenario of fiscal restraint also in this and in the upcoming in important emerging despite the resilience of domestic the pace of activity has in as a consequence of policy actions and the weakening of external through the external trade in specific changes in the growth pattern are a development that tends to be until the committee evaluates that the international scenario has shown disinflationary for the there are cumulative evidences supporting the view that the transmission of external developments to the brazilian economy materializes through several among moderation of total moderation in investment flows and tighter credit the committee understands that the effects of the complexity surrounding the international environment added up to those stemming from the moderation of domestic in other the moderation process the brazilian economy was already experiencing in the first half of last year was intensified by the weakness of the global the copom that although domestic demand expansion has also been prospects for economic activity in this and in the upcoming semesters are with some asymmetry among the several this assessment is supported by signs that point to moderate expansion of credit supply both for individuals and and by the fact that and stands at high the copom that the domestic activity will continue to be benefited by public as well as by the labor market mirrored in historically low unemployment rates and in wages despite some accommodation at the the copom reaffirms its view that inflation accumulated in twelve which started to retreat in the last quarter of last tends to continue the decline to move towards the targets the committee evaluates that the reversion in the inflation trend will contribute to improve the economic especially price about the dynamics of inflation in the upcoming the committee understands that this improvement in the sentiment tends to be boosted by the ongoing process of moderation in the dynamic of producer prices and at wholesale the copom notes that the main inflation scenario considers the materialization of the assumed trajectories regarding fiscal it bears highlighting that the generation of primary surpluses in line with the hypotheses considered for inflation in addition to contributing to reduce the mismatches between supply and demand growth will strengthen the reduction trend of the public the copom highlights that its main scenario also considers moderate expansion in the credit still about the credit the committee considers opportune the initiatives with the aim of moderating the concession of subsidies through credit the copom evaluates as decreasing the risks stemming from the persistence of the in specific between supply and demand growth it highlights the narrow idleness margin in the despite the signs of moderation in this and considers under such an important risk stems from the possibility of concession of wages increases incompatible with productivity growth and their negative impacts over inflation on the other the copom notes that the level of installed capacity utilization has stabilized and is below the in other it is contributing to the opening of the output gap and to contain prices the copom considers that the deceleration of the brazilian economy in the second half of was deeper than that recent events indicate the postponement of a final solution for the european financial and that the risks related to the deleveraging process stemming from families and government under way in major economic blocks remain these and other constitute an economic environment in which a much uncertainty level for the the prospective scenario for since the last has maintained favorable the committee also notes according to the main scenario the inflation rate stands around the target in in the copom considers at the present the risks to the inflation trajectory remain the committee also notes until due to the global the external sector contribution has been in this continuing the process of monetary conditions the copom unanimously decided to decrease the selic rate to without the copom evaluates that domestic demand tends to show especially household largely due to the effects of stimulus such as income growth and moderate credit this scenario tends to prevail in this and in the upcoming when domestic demand will be impacted by the effects of monetary policy actions recently which in lagged and on the other the committee considers that recent initiatives reinforce a scenario for restrained public sector another important factor to curb aggregate demand is the still fragile international these elements and quasi fiscal developments are an important part of the context in which future monetary policy decisions will be aiming to ensure the timely convergence of inflation to the targets the copom understands that brazilian economy has experienced significant structural which determined retreat in the interest rates in general in in the neutral among the factors that support this it bears highlighting the reduction of risk a direct consequence of the accomplishment of the inflation target for the eighth consecutive of the macroeconomic stability and of institutional the process of interest rates reduction was favored by changes in the structure of the financial and capital by the credit market as well as by the generation of primary surpluses consistent with the maintenance of decreasing trend for the public for the all these changes are characterized by a high degree of persistence due to the economic cycles specific and temporary reversions may occur and contribute for the brazilian economy to currently present solid indicators of solvency and the copom also considers that the increase in the supply of external savings and the reduction of its funding cost have contributed to the reduction of the domestic interest including the neutral according to the are largely permanent in light of the even considering that the activity recovery has occurred more slowly than the committee believes given the cumulative and lagged effects of policy actions implemented so any movement of additional monetary easing should be conducted with at the end of the it was announced that the committee will reconvene on may for the technical and on the following to discuss monetary as established in the communiqué of june of data analyzed by the copom the rose in down from in totaling in the year and in the twelve months through

the movement reflected the strong deceleration in the prices of to down from mainly influenced by the deceleration in the services which decreased to from while the prices of tradable goods changed
